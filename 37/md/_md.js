[Chapter 7: Court procedure]
----------------------------------------------------------

### Putting things on the record

The first thing to remember about your first appearance … an important opportunity to put things on the record. For example, … tell the magistrate at the earliest possible opportunity if:

    - …
    - you have a complaint;
    - …
    - …
    - …

If you don't … that 'failure' may be used against you later to cast doubt on your claims.


### Court protocol

Whenever you speak … you are expected to stand ….… In New South Wales, both are now called 'Your Honour'. … stand up when a magistrate or judge enters … no need to bow, as lawyers do.

… basic politeness is wise…, but don't degrade yourself. The magistrate does have the power in her or his court to have people arrested and charged for 'contempt of court' – for offensive or disruptive behaviour … even if you don't like the magistrate, you … have to convince to treat you fairly.

Police prosecutors and lawyers stand behind the 'bar table' … when presenting their arguments, or asking questions of witnesses. If you represent yourself, stand next to the table unless, or until, the magistrate invites you to stand behind the table. As an unrepresented …, … magistrate is supposed to assist … with … basic procedures, such as asking … if you'd like to ask a witness … questions. (… research properly, … have … questions prepared …!)

…


[Chapter 8: Pleas]
----------------------------------------------------------

### Considering the implications of a guilty plea

… If there are inaccuracies (including possible errors over past convictions), make sure you point them out to police and to the magistrate. Make a formal 'objection' to the magistrate if an inaccurate 'fact sheet' is presented.


### When should I plead guilty?

However, if the case against you looks bad, … You can still argue factors in 'mitigation' – circumstances that may be taken into account to reduce the penalty.

…

However, where you have a reasonable defence, and do not believe you did anything wrong, then it is not necessarily the case that you will receive a greater penalty if you are found guilty. To the contrary, pleading guilty in these circumstances may suggest that you knew you did the wrong thing, and so you are inviting a harsh penalty.

As a general rule, do not plead guilty to a charge if you believe, after due consideration of all the facts, that you have not done anything wrong.

### When should I plead not guilty?

Plead not guilty … if you believe, after due consideration of all the facts… have not done anything wrong. Also … you believe … charge is inappropriate or excessive.

… your right to defend any charge laid against you, … by law (Australian law and international human rights law) … entitled … presumed innocent until proven guilty; … police … media may not … share this view.

… advantages of pleading not guilty:

- … prosecution … 'put to proof' – … must prove your guilt, and you must have … benefit of any reasonable doubt;
- you remain in a morally strong position and can be more assertive of your rights through the entire process;
- you have a chance of acquittal – if … acquitted … clear of the charge and no conviction is recorded.

The disadvantages of pleading not guilty are:

- … hearing … witnesses giving evidence against you; … may be long and stressful;
- … need to prepare and take 'time out' for what might be … prolonged … battle;
- if you are not eligible for legal aid, you will either need to spend a good deal of extra time yourself in preparation, or pay a lawyer substantial amounts of money; the costs will be greater than those for a guilty plea.




[Chapter 9: Hearings and trials]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
…

### Hearings

A hearing before a magistrate is sometimes called a summary hearing, because it is decided straight away, or 'summarily'.

In a summary hearing you might not receive any advance warning of witnesses or evidence to be called. However, you are entitled, well before the hearing, to a statement of alleged 'facts' on which the prosecution is basing its case. This statement should let you know what you must answer. From this information you can consider which parts of the prosecution case you should investigate, as well as whether you wish to call any witnesses. If … prosecution … in court departs radically from … statement of 'facts' …, you are entitled to ask for an adjournment, to further investigate these new 'facts'.

…

For contested matters … basic processes … is outlined …


1. Plea
   - A formal plea is asked for: guilty or not guilty.
2. Prosecution case
   - The prosecution opens, outlining its case to the court.
   - Prosecution evidence is then called, generally through witnesses. 
     The defence may then cross-examine these witnesses; 
     the prosecutor may then re-examine each witness.
   - The defence may then submit that there is no case to answer.
3. Defence case
   - The defence opens, and outlines its case.
   - Defence evidence is then called, 
     which may then be cross-examined or objected to by the prosecution. 
     The defence may then re-examine each witness.
4. Closing addresses
   - The prosecutor gives the first address, to the magistrate or jury (or judge alone).
   - The defence gives the second address.
5. The verdict
   - … given by the magistrate
6. Sentencing
   - If there is a plea or finding of guilty, the magistrate or judge moves to sentencing. 
     Here the prosecution and defence may again call witnesses, who can be cross-examined.


The central issue in a criminal hearing or trial is always whether or not the prosecution has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt. No person has to prove her or his innocence. The law presumes a person, before and during trial and after acquittal, to be innocent. This principle is not always respected by police and the media, but it is the law and it is a fundamental common law right. If a person is found not guilty, she or he is free to leave the court.

### Committals

For more serious charges, a committal (or preliminary) hearing is held in the Local Court to decide whether or not the prosecution has a case to go to trial in a higher court. This is a place to test the prosecution evidence, but generally not to go all out to discredit it. This would be a wasted effort as most matters do proceed to trial.

When you are facing a serious charge, the prosecutor must give you a list of prosecution witnesses and copies of their statements at some stage prior to the committal proceedings. This is called the prosecution's 'brief' of evidence. After reading these statements, you have to decide which persons you want to question. You must then give the prosecution notice of whom you wish to question or cross-examine, so they can be called as witnesses. If you don't want to question any of them, there will simply be a 'paper committal', where the magistrate decides on the basis of the written statements whether you have a 'case to answer', and so whether the matter should go to trial.

If you are charged with an offence involving violence, there is a prohibition on the cross-examination of any alleged victim in committal proceedings, unless there are 'special reasons'. This may influence your decision over whether to elect for a 'paper committal'. If you have no conflict with the evidence of the police but only with that of the victim, for example, you may consider a paper committal. If you want to contest police evidence, however, you can make use of the opportunity to cross-examine them at the committal. To be able to cross-examine other witnesses you may be asked to provide substantial reasons.

On the odd occasion where the prosecution cannot prove an element of its charge, you will be discharged at the committal stage. For example, in a drug case the prosecution may not be able to show continuous possession, that is, they cannot prove that the drugs subsequently analysed were the same substance found on you. In another example, if you have extremely strong evidence that you were in a different place when the charged crime was committed, you may choose to call this evidence. However, unless you are certain you will beat the charge, only give defence evidence at a committal as a last resort.

There's also usually little point in a dramatic attack on a prosecution witness at a committal. You should make it clear to a witness if you are saying she or he is not telling the truth, but save your 'big guns' for the jury. If you have any surprises, keep them in reserve for the trial. It's usually best, tactically, not to reveal all details of your defence at the committal. Also there's usually not much to be gained by calling defence witnesses – they can wait for the trial.

Use a committal to discover things about the prosecution evidence. Use subpoenas to get access to police records (see Preparation), and plan to question witnesses to draw out information. You can also make objections to evidence you consider to be inadmissible (see Evidence).


[Chapter 10: Preparation]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[ ] collect evidence rapidly;
[ ] obtain charge details;
[ ] research the law;
[ ] consider your defences;
[ ] investigate the prosecution case;
[ ] use subpoenas; and
[ ] apply to have the charges dropped.


### Collect evidence early

Make sure to also obtain:

- a doctor's written record (and photographs, if possible) of any injuries you may have suffered;
- photographs or videos of any of the circumstances leading to your arrest; and
- any physical evidence, for example, documents

... collect ... statements of ... witnesses, ... Get their statements, not promises ...

...

### Obtain Charge Details 

... obtain ... important details from ... prosecution, asap:

1. charge sheet – ... the charge precisely, and generally give a 'statute reference';
2. particulars – ... 'facts' sheet ... precisely you are meant to have done; 
3. brief – ... prosecution witnesses' statements.

...

The name of the arresting officer, or at least the charging officer, should appear on the charge sheet and the 'facts' sheet. If not, ask... If ... particulars ... appear to be missing, ask the prosecutor... or ask ... when you're before the magistrate. 

If adequate particulars are not provided, request an adjournment until they are... entitled to know exactly what you will be required to answer at your hearing...


### Research the law

Once you have a copy of the charge sheet and the particulars, you can look up the relevant law... For NSW offences you may be dealing with the [Crimes Act 1900], the [Bail Act], the [Evidence Act] and the [Summary Offences Act 1988]. For offences under Commonwealth legislation look at the [Commonwealth Crimes Act 1914], the [Criminal Code 1995 (Cth)] and the [Evidence Act 1995 (Cth)]..

... Acts of Parliament (or statutes) must be **observed to the word** by the courts, so pay attention to their exact wording. Each offence listed in an Act carries with it important details:

    the elements of each offence (there are often two or more issues that have to be proved to establish the offence); and
    the maximum penalty for the offence.

Once you have this statutory information, you will need to look at what common law applies. The common law, or judge-made law, is made up of cases that have interpreted the statutory law. For this information you'll need to go to the Commonwealth and State law reports, but useful summaries are contained in some basic law manuals. The most valuable of these are loose-leaf services, which are updated as legislative amendments are made and usually spell out the elements of each charge.

If, for example, you have been charged with obstruction, you need to identify each major element of the charge. The prosecution needs to prove each major element beyond reasonable doubt. Legally, your task in defending the charge is then to establish a 'reasonable doubt' about at least one of these major elements. The charge sheet could look something like this:

That Mary Brown at Marrickville, Sydney, on the 23rd day of September 2005, intentionally obstructed Constable John Plodd, a member of the police force, in the due execution of his duty.

Break this charge down into its essential elements, as follows:

1. That Mary Brown at Marrickville, Sydney, on the 23rd day of September 2005 …

The prosecution has to prove this beyond reasonable doubt – but usually the details of person, place and date are accurate. If not, the prosecutor can usually amend it (with the court's permission) unless the trial and evidence has proceeded on a different basis for some time.

2. intentionally obstructed Constable John Plodd

The prosecution has to prove this beyond reasonable doubt – and this may well be the most contentious issue.

3. a member of the police force

This is probably not an issue – but the prosecution must still prove it.

4. in the due execution of his duty

The prosecution also needs to prove this beyond reasonable doubt – and this is also open to attack. Was Plodd acting unreasonably? Unlawfully? The prosecution must prove that he was acting 'in the due execution of duty' and not on some individual venture of his own.

You will need evidence – either through cross-examination of prosecution witnesses (for example, by questioning John Plodd) or by calling your own witnesses – to support your challenge to the elements of this charge.

Where possible when researching the law, seek advice from experienced lawyers, as there is a web of interrelated Acts, common law and rules of practice. It is here that case law may be helpful. You might be able to find judgments that have considered behaviour similar to Constable Plodd's to be unreasonable, or outside the execution of duty. These judgments can be quoted in support of your case.


### Consider your defences
While the central part of a defence is to knock down, or rather cast doubt on, the elements of the charge(s), there are also some common law and statutory defences that you can raise. A little research is required to see which would be most valuable to argue. The following are some possible options:


### Common law defences
These are defences 'at large', which may be applied to defend one's actions against all sorts of charges. Defences make actions lawful, which otherwise would not be. They include:

    self-defence (now a statutory defence in New South Wales, for some offences);
    insanity (unfit to plead);
    mental illness;
    necessity;
    reasonable or lawful excuse;
    duress; and
    claim of right (for example, you did not intend to steal something but believed you owned it).

In addition, two defences:

    diminished responsibility; and
    provocation,

may mitigate the penalty or reduce a charge of murder to the lesser, alternate charge of manslaughter.

In the example above, Mary Brown could argue that she had every right to be out on the street in Marrickville at a demonstration, and that it was the police who created trouble. If she had also been charged with 'assaulting police', she may like to argue that any contact with the police was by way of self-defence.


### Statutory defences
An offence contained in an Act of Parliament will sometimes have a particular defence written into it, such as 'without lawful excuse' or 'without reasonable excuse'. If this is the case, you may like to argue that you had a 'reasonable excuse', and you would typically need to prove this 'on the balance of probabilities' (that is, more likely than not). You need to check the Acts from which the statutory charges come. Case law may also be helpful. You may be able to find cases similar to yours where 'reasonable excuse' was successfully argued.

...

### Investigate the prosecution evidence
When you have the particulars of the charge, and even more importantly, the statements of prosecution witnesses, you are able to check the facts asserted in those statements. You can ask a friend or a lawyer to interview prosecution witnesses. The prosecution does not 'own' its witnesses, and they are able to speak to anyone. However, it may be better for the person charged not to directly approach them, in case a suggestion is made that they are being intimidated. The prosecution witnesses might be able to provide information that may help your case, as much as it may help the case of the prosecution.

If you have been committed for trial, contact the District or Supreme Court Registry and ask for a copy of the 'depositions' from the committal (that is, the transcripts of evidence). These should be provided free of charge. Also ask for a copy of all exhibits tendered at the committal, and a copy of the proposed indictment. The prosecution may change the wording of the indictment between the committal and trial, but if they do so they must give you a copy.

As with collecting evidence from your own witnesses, take steps to investigate prosecution evidence as soon as possible. The more you know about the prosecution case and their witnesses, the more informed your questions will be at trial.

You can investigate prosecution witnesses' assertions by questioning other witnesses about the same events, or by looking at documentary records of those events. Some records are available for the asking, but there is also a process (the issuing of subpoenas) by which you can demand that specified documents be produced to the court.


### Use subpoenas
Being before the court on a charge allows you to use some of the authority of the court to force disclosure of evidence. For instance, you may wish to subpoena (call for) a police officer's notebook, to check against her or his statement; or you may subpoena police, governmental or private records relating to an action you were involved in.

A subpoena may also require that a person appear in court to give evidence, or to produce relevant documents. It may, however, be risky to subpoena people to give evidence if you don't have a statement from them – you cannot predict the evidence they will give, and it may not all be helpful to your case.

A court official or lawyer will tell you how to fill out a subpoena, which must be stamped by the Clerk of the Local Court or Registrar. Courts also usually have a filing fee, which you have to pay unless you have legal aid or a low income. You, or someone on your behalf, must then physically 'serve' the subpoena on the party from whom the evidence is required (that is, deliver it to her or him personally). You should keep a record of when and by whom the subpoena was served, in case it is denied that a subpoena was received. Subpoena return dates should be well before the hearing or trial date, to allow time to check any information they might disclose.

In court you will have to 'call on' the subpoena, that is, ask for the person to produce the documents, or produce herself or himself to give evidence.

Be careful in drafting a subpoena. It must be for some 'legitimate forensic purpose', relevant to the charge. If it is not precise enough (too wide or too vague) then it may be ruled invalid, and you will have wasted your time and money.


### Apply to have the charges dropped
Police have a discretion (subject to the scrutiny of the court) to withdraw a prosecution. An application may be made to the Officer in Charge, Prosecution Office at the Regional Headquarters of the region involved in the matter. The officer will consider these criteria:

    the triviality of the offence;
    the character of the defendant;
    any demonstrable error of fact or law on the part of police; and
    any psychiatric or medical issues.

In practice though, once a charge is laid, prosecutors generally only consider whether or not they can prove the charge.

In more serious matters, prosecuted by the Director of Public Prosecutions, a prosecution may be 'no billed' (that is, not prosecuted) even after it has been committed for trial. In this case the application is made to the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. In your application you may like to point out the weakness of the prosecution evidence against you (if it is weak) or indicate the existence of powerful defence evidence. However, don't give away too much of your defence case. If you do go on to trial, for tactical reasons, you may wish to save some surprises for the prosecution.

Representations for charges to be withdrawn, or for matters not to proceed to trial, may require adjournments of several months while they are being determined. Notice that adjournments will give you more time to prepare your case, if the charge does proceed.

Applying for a stay of proceedings (that is, a temporary or permanent suspension of the case) is another means of avoiding a trial. You can apply to the court for a stay, for example, on the grounds that the prosecution is an abuse of process. You can also apply for a quashing of the indictment, on the grounds that on the facts stated, an offence is not disclosed.

Other applications that may be made before a trial include an application for orders for a separate trial, or for a separation of the counts (if there are multiple charges). For example, if you are charged with several robberies, you can reasonably argue that you would face great prejudice before a jury if all charges were heard together. The jury might be so suspicious that they would convict, even if the evidence were thin on each count.








Costs

If a summary charge against you is dismissed, or you are discharged at committal, you can apply to the magistrate for an order for costs. The magistrate has a discretion to order the informant (usually the police) to pay you 'just and reasonable' costs.

The court might not award costs in your favour if your conviction is set aside on appeal unless it is satisfied that:

- the investigation was conducted in an unreasonable or improper manner;
- the proceedings were initiated without reasonable cause or in bad faith, or were improperly conducted by the prosecutor;
- the prosecution unreasonably failed to investigate, or to investigate properly, a relevant matter, of which it was or should have been aware, and the court suggested that you might not be guilty or that the proceedings should not have been brought; or
- because of other exceptional circumstances relating to the prosecutor's conduct of the proceedings, it is reasonable and just to award costs to you.

In New South Wales, you may be able to apply for a certificate under the [Costs in Criminal Cases Act 1967 (NSW)]. This scheme is broader, in that it applies to persons who are acquitted from either a summary or indictable offence, and the grounds for awarding costs are not as strict.




[Going to court: guide to the Local Court for defendants]:
==========================================================
----------------------------------------------------------


### In the courtroom...

If you do not have a lawyer the Magistrate will ask you a number of questions. When answering, you should address the Magistrate as “Your Honour”.

The first questions you are likely to be asked are:

    Are you ..........? (your name)
    Do you have a lawyer representing you?
    Do you wish to have your matter dealt with today?

The Magistrate asks this question to see if you are ready to deal with your case or need an adjournment for an appropriate reason, eg to get legal advice. You would usually be given one adjournment if you ask for it.


### On the day of the hearing

The police will present their case first. They will call their witnesses to give evidence, for example the police officer in charge of your case (also sometimes called the 'OIC') and any other witnesses. After each witness gives evidence, you or your lawyer have the right to cross-examine (question) them about their evidence or about other matters relevant to your case.

After the prosecutor has called all of their witnesses you are entitled to give evidence (if you want to) and to call witnesses. Generally, if you choose to give evidence,you would be the first defence witness to give evidence. The prosecutor is likely to cross-examine (question) you. Then you can call your witnesses. After each one gives evidence the prosecutor can cross-examine them. Each witness must wait outside the court room until it is their turn to give evidence. Make sure your witnesses are at court on the day of the hearing to give evidence in person.

After all witnesses have given evidence the prosecutor may make submissions to the magistrate about why you should be found guilty of the offence. You can then make submissions, that is, tell the court why you should be found "not guilty" based on the evidence.

The Magistrate, after hearing both the police and defence case will decide either that:

    Your case is dismissed, which means you are free to go and you have been found not guilty, or
    You have been found guilty. If this happens the Magistrate will then consider the penalty.

### Stalking

- Didn't want to got to O'Neill office sent lawyer






# 474.15

## Background

At the mercy of O'Neill Strata Management *(OSM)* and my Strata Committee *(SC)*:

|                     |                     |
|---------------------|---------------------|
|**Feb 2017 - Dec 2017** I was homeless due to a decade of water leaking and irresponsible building maintenance. Concrete cancer had spread all through my apartment floor and the rusted steal bars had to be exposed by jackhammer and treated. Strata were not in a rush to fix the apartment properly, nor transparent over the extent of damage and how long the repairs would take. I literally did not know where I should sleep from week to week and asked hundreds of times for a schedule without answer.|*![Homeless](/atchd/15d3ed07bc923a23__IMG_6168.jpg__inln.jpg)*|
|**May 2017** After requesting a General Meeting agenda item to discuss Strata Manager accountability, OSM illegitimately revoked my voting rights and distributed minutes to all my neighbors saying that I was "*unfinancial*" when I had paid my building levies, even though I didn't have access to my own home.|*![Unfinancial](/img/unfinancial.png)*|
|**Jun 2017** After 2 months notice and 15+ written follow-up requests, OSM refused to undertake due maintenance on the water mains, resulting in a leak that saturated my apartment through to the ceiling of the apartment below|*![Leak](/atchd/15bff707e8c001eb__image_6483441.JPG__inln.jpg)*|
|**Sep 2017** I returned from overseas to check repair progress and found the Committee trespassed into my apartment and dumped garbage from the street in my master bedroom. I reported the incidents to the police on-line (screenshot available), but the reports could not be accepted. I went to the station and the officers on duty convinced me not to pursue the matter.|*![Dumping](/atchd/15f21c876fd107b5__IMG_6835.jpg__inln.jpg)*|
|**Dec 2017** ALL my personal belongings were ruined. I had moved everything from my apartment into my garage for the duration of the concrete cancer repairs - including clothing, electronics, furniture, art and antiques I'd collected since childhood. When I noticed the pipes in the garage were dripping, I write to OSM 4 times and discussing the problem at two general meetings. I was completely ignored and felt chronically ill-treated.|*![Leather jacket](/atchd/160de651cc16e4c4__2017-03-28-IMG_4743_crop.JPG)*|

The personal property damage, financial losses, stress and anxiety from not knowing
where to sleep each week became too heavy. By xMas time, Strata had left me a half
repaired concrete shell unable to start my renovation. They refused to share the
engineering reports and contractor correspondence outlining the structural integrity of
my floor. I had no idea where I was standing, so I decided I would sue the Committee
and O'Niell.

I laid temporary mats in one room, ordered a temporary mattress, setup a desk and
knuckled down to prepare a case. In the meantime, with no bathroom, in 2018 I have been
showing using a hose on the balcony. I can't even keep the balcony clean because the
failing roof waterproofing floods the brickwork and tiles with dirty debris every time
it rains which doesn't drain properly because the storm water pipe was left half
excavated and busted.

Every single time I shower or even go to the toilet, I am exposed to outside cold/
rain. This is my daily living situation. It's emotionally very draining.

## The "Incident"

On top of the grime a combination of ants, caterpillars and cockroaches regularly come
down from the rooftop to hang out in the decaying masonry and even in my one temporary
bedroom. Our building is not diligently pest treated. Neighbors even had termites in
their garage.

![Termites](/img/termites.jpg)

On *Dec 20, 2017* and again on *Dec 22, 2017* I emailed OSM asking to organize for the
rooftop and other common areas to be treated.

Like the time OSM let my floor flood until it leaked through the ceiling below and
allowing my personal belonging to be ruined from dripping garage pipes, I was ignored.

A couple months later, I noticed what were identified by my doctor's pathology lab to be
cockroach eggs, all around my apartment. They had burrowed tunnels through walls
in-between rooms. They had also burrowed into the double layer brick walls separating my
apartment from the neighbors and into the service stacks housing the water mains and
storm water pipes.

I had been feeling unwell since moving into the building in 2015 and was particularly
off Jan-Mar 2018. In April 2018 I was diagnosed by a US specialist with Chronic Lyme
Disease. Being subjected by Strata to all the above nonsense and not able to maintain a
clean, healthy environment brought huge unnecessary additional day to day stress and
complication to personal health.

### The Correspondence

The following forked email thread took place between the Committee chairperson appointed
mid-December 2017 and John O'Neill of O'Neill Strata management who decided it
worthy to report to the police.

## Police interaction

5 days passed before I heard via my father, who heard from my uncle, who was told by
a member of my Strata Committee that John O'Neill had reported me to the
Police. I had no idea what about or how I could be "the villain" after the things OSM
had done. At first, learning John claimed I threatened to shoot him with a gun didn't
click. When I realized, removed far from realistic context, the phrase ***"Pull the
trigger"***, commonly used by professionals my age (particularly in tech) was culprit, I
barely took the situation seriously. The first costly mistake on my part.

![Pull the trigger Google results](/img/474-ptt-google.png)

### Called to the station

I was eager to as quickly as possible remove all doubt surrounding the hyperbole
misinterpretation and false accusation. My dad and I immediately visited Waverly
station to speak with Constable Junior, the office handling John's report. I'm
certain things would not have unfolded as they did, had I been able during this visit
to answer Constable Jr's questions with my father present and at my side.

On the morning of Sunday, 25th of Mar 2018, I received a call from Constable Jr
requesting to come to Bondi Station. Still in a rush to get things off my chest and
nonchalantly confident that the truth was straight forward and would prevail,
I immediately made my way to the station. When I arrived I met Jr and was
asked to take a seat alone with him in a small room. Looking back, I was naively
off-guard. Being my first encounter of this nature, I was inexperienced and far too
unprepared to handle the unanticipated deceptive agenda beneath what I assumed would
be a reasonable, unbiased exercise in clarifying the truth surrounding the exchanged words.

### The "Pre-recorded" conversation

**Jr.** Asked how I was

**Me.** I answered along the lines of *"I had not been well and was chronically
frustrated with the situation in my home. Having no floor or proper place to shower,
the situation was negatively impacting my day to day comfort and ability to manage
health."*

**Me.** I started getting into how I was feeling about O'Neill Strata Management.

**Jr.** Stopped me in my tracks *"I can see you are frustrated and emotional about this
experience, let's hold it there, I want to focus on asking a few questions".*

**Me.** I wanted and made a point to let Jr. know that I did not have the full context
of what was going on or why I had been called to the station. I requested he explain to
me what allegations were being made and by whom. To elaborate on what I was asking, I
explained that *"I am entangled with O'Neill in a civil/Strata dispute and had already
spent significant time and resources familiarizing myself with with Strata law and the
different civil courts... With Strata, you had to refer to specific clause from
specific act like the Strata Schemes Management Act or the Property Stock and Business
License Act, that had being breached."*

Jr. had a printed copy of the final messages exchanged with myself and John O'Neill.
So I asked specifically to understand on what grounds was I being questioned, because the
only information I had was that a phase I had used, “Pull the trigger” had been taken
way out of context ignoring the rest of the email in which it appeared, and re-imagined
as having something to do with using a gun to shoot someone when neither words, "gun" or
"shoot" were ever previously communicated by myself to any related party. Nor did I own
or had ever shot a gun.

**Jr.** deflected answering my request for context by taping the printed email open handed bringing my focus to his agenda *"We can talk about that in a bit, but first I want to ask you questions about this".*

\`\`\`
Re: SP 13385 - Ants

Pathology of the Infectious Diseases department at St Vincents has confirmed these
to be sacks of Cockroach eggs. They are know to cause Asthma and Eczema and various
other ailments.

You may choose to ignore me again, but it will be shown in court, you have been warned
these things have burrowed through boundary walls.

This isn't a game. Your fucking incompetents leaving the rooftop membrane leaking
for multiple years and consistently fumbling strict maintenance duty is fucking
up people's health.

I'm coming for you the second I'm feeling healthy enough to pull the trigger.
\`\`\`

**Me.** Feeling uncomfortable with a physically printed skewed perspective of the
situation, I tried to boot my laptop to have balancing material handy. I needed a power
socket. I asked Jr. if I could plug in my laptop and he said "no". Then I asked if
there was a wireless Internet connection I could use and he said there was no WIFI
available. I tried to show one or two things on my cracked iPhone, but it was futile so
I requested an email address where I could submit evidence after I'd gone home and had
time to collect relevant items.

Jr. was a probationary officer and he did not do a good job at explaining the severity
of the situation. To the contrary, he outright ignored framing the circumstances. I had no idea:

1. I could be charged solely on the hand-recorded questions he asked next.
2. My request to submit evidence was being ignored and signing his questions, I would not have a fair opportunity to submit material supporting my story.
3. Instead of uncovering truth, his primary goal was to come as close as possible to admitting a crime I didn't even know existed, regardless of my innocence.
4. Officers would play word-smith preparing a "Full facts" report, chopping and bending sentences and language to confuse what was actually said.

Before we proceeded, Jr. made clear the questions I was about to answer
"could be used as evidence". If he had made clear they could completely comprise ground
to be charged, I would have been on higher alert. I was extremely confident the
evidence I would follow up with and submit would speak for itself.

I most definitely answered everything "truthfully", but I didn't answer things
"comprehensively". I didn't want to waste Jr.'s time. The best example, was the question
"Who was the email intended for?". At first I hesitated and said it's complicated. Then
I answered the simplest truth, "I intended John O'Neill to receive and read it". What I
didn't answer was I also expected other staff at O'Neill to receive and read it
since the address I sent the emails to was not a personal email address, but actually a
customer service contact address and I also expected the email to be forwarded to the
Strata Committee, which happened most times I emailed O'Neill and in this instance as
well.

### The "recorded" conversation

My recollection of the hand-recorded part of the encounter was along the lines of:

**Jr.** How long have you known John O'Neill ?

**Me.** Approximately 3 years.

**Jr.** How many times have you interacted?

**Me.** Hundreds of emails

**Jr.** Who was the email you sent intended for

**Me.** It's complicated... I guess I intended John O'Neill to receive it.

**Jr.** What was the intention of your email

**Me.** That I didn't want him to forget I was going to sue him shortly.

**Jr.** Did you intent to cause John significant harm?

**Me.** Can you clarify what you mean by harm? I was intending to sue him.

**Jr.** Did you intent to cause John significant harm?

**Me.** I mean perhaps significant financial harm. Certainly not any physical harm.

**Jr.** Did you intent John to feel threatened?

**Me.** I guess... that's the point of saying you are going to sue someone.

**Jr.** Did you intend to follow through on your threat.

**Me.** I'm 100% pursuing litigation.

At the end of the questions, Constable Jr read back the questions and answers to me.
Nothing seemed untrue. But by no means did I see the interview as an accurate
representation of events, in terms of completeness.

I asked him if I'd made it clear I had no violent intent and Jr. confessed to
me that he did not believe I was violent.

He asked me to sign the questions as a "true" record, which I interpreted
signing that I had answered his questions truthfully to the best of my ability.

I had stated for the record, that I did not have any violent intent and that my only
plan was litigation and that it wasn't breaking the law to tell someone why you were
suing them (in my case for putting the health and safety on occupants in my building at
risk). I was expecting things to be over momentarily and that evidence probably wouldn't
be required to show I was not breaking any laws.

Constable Jr left the room and in came his senior, who confessed Constable Jr was in
training and wanted to know what I thought. I answered that he conducted himself like
"a champion". I signed that I didn't think or was aware that the questioning had been
conducted unfairly. Unfortunate looking back, since a moment later I would realize I
clearly didn't understand what was going on. I honestly thought the interview would be
impartial and unbiased in this type of situation.

### Post-"recorded" exchange and ignored follow ups

The senior office left the room and Constable Jr. re-entered after a few moments. Then
he said *I'm probably going to charge you for "Threat of serious harm over carriage
service."*

My jaw dropped.

Immediately I freaked out and said, *"hold on, I'd like not to exchange another word
until the senior officer from before and my father is present. I obviously have no idea
what is going on and have misinterpreted the situation completely. If anyone has been
harassed it's me by John O'Neill and the Strata Committee."*

Constable Jr left the room to grab the senior office who came in before, but he was
busy, so a different senior office came in and immediately started aggressively
screaming at me.

3 times I timidly asked the Senior Constable to lower his voice. All I remember him
screaming in an intentionally intimidating manner was *"Get out of here, I've
got better things to do with my day than deal with you."* The Irony of the situation was
very concerning. The Senior Constable felt I didn't deserve the respect to be heard and
explained the situation fairly, to avoid being falsely charged and possibly jailed for 7
years for threating behavior and it was ok to aggressive scream in my face and ignore my
requests to tone down his behavior so we could conduct a conversation and I could
understand what had and was going to happen.

When he finally cooled off and Constable Jr began explaining that I would get a notice
to attend court, I protested to him that he failed to explain to me the
allegations being brought against me at the beginning of our meeting. His reply made me
realize how deceptive the whole interaction had been. He said *"As if I'm going to tell
you what you're being charged for"* clearly shedding light, that he thought he was doing
a good job in how he was being trained to conduct the questioning.

I then protested that it was irresponsible to consider phrases in isolation discarding
the fact that in the context of the email it directly followed discussion about
taking O'Neill to court and that the phrase had commonly accepted meaning having
nothing to do with firearms.

The Senior constable challenged me on the spot and said *"yeah like what?"*. I
replied, *"I work in tech and we would use that phrase before sending a push
notification or email campaign to a customer base".* He completely dismissed my argument
as if I had made it up on the spot and insisted the only possible meaning for the phrase
was to shoot a gun.

Over the next few days, my dad tried to contact Constable Jr. I called and left a
message with Officer Symington for Constable Jr. to submit additional evidence and a
Lawyer called twice. We were all ignore ignored.

On advice that the interview was taken by notebook and the matter seemed like a small
issue likely to disappear, I decided not submit a formal complaint. I went to the US
for a month to see medical specialists. When I got home and checked my mail, a
notice to attend court was waiting.

## Charge

I received notice to attend court and defend an incredibly serious bogus charge brought
against me for using "carriage service" *(email)* to "threaten serious harm", where
"victim feared for safety".

With up to 7 years in jail by false conviction, I lost plenty of sleep over what to do with the prejudicial garbage presented as full facts from a naively unsuspecting and inexplicably misleadingly "investigative" questioning
carried out by the police.

https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2006C00305
\`\`\`
474.15  Using a carriage service to make a threat to cause serious harm

  A person (the first person) is guilty of an offence if:

  (a)  the first person uses a carriage service to make to another person (the second
       person) a threat to cause serious harm to the second person or a third person;
       and
  (b)  the first person intends the second person to fear that the threat will be
       carried out.

  Penalty:  Imprisonment for 7 years.

  Actual fear not necessary. Fear includes apprehension.
  Threat to cause serious harm to a person includes
    a threat to substantially contribute to serious harm to the person.
  In a prosecution for an offence against this section, it is not necessary to prove
    that the person receiving the threat actually feared
    that the threat would be carried out

### My intent

I had told O'Niell I was suing him in writing more than 10 times. An NCAT application has
been submitted. A lot of evidence is available showing my intent including sending
lawyers to O'Neill's office to inspect the Strata records in January.

### Prior harassment

#### Over email

I had asked O'Neill to stop emailing me repeatedly, but throughout January O'Neill
insisted he continue to email and attempt to argue with me.

#### In my apartment

I have violent threats by the building contractors in writing/email that are the result
of O'Neill and the Strata Committee's conduct in refusing to properly repair my apartment.

### Skewing of context

Imagine on a holiday in the USA, someone had recorded you complimenting a person's "thong(s)" and before you know it, you find yourself accused of Sexual Harassment.

You claim *"All I wanted was to know where they bought their shoes"*. To complicate what seems an obvious misinterpretation to you, folks in the USA are more sensitive on sexual equality than what you've been exposed to back home. After explaining what seemed a straight forward misinterpretation nonsensical to associate with you, you realized the context needed considering to appreciate your view. After all you said "thongs" not "thong". In your mind, even if you'd been aware of the difference in cultural perception of "thong" to be a *"skimpy pair of knickers like a G-string."*, the accusation couldn't add up, because people don't wear more than one. However,
for reason you can't comprehend or fathom as fair, in supposed "Full facts" for a judge to accept as the truth, the language was sliced exact to optimize a certain point of view. The 's' is gone and "thong" is in-fact the topic to be discussed.

Looking at the available evidence with a few moments of warranted patience for convicting someone mistakenly of criminal offense, I will explain how the presented "Full facts" sheet does not soundly add up.


### Wordplay & omitting primary fact

There are countless problems in construction of the allegation. To start:

**I am not, nor have I ever demonstrated violent and harassing behavior or intent.**

The fact sheet ignores my testimony that my exclusive intension of the email in question was to pursue litigation.

Conviction requires
- (a) proof of intent to cause serious *(physical)* harm and;
- (b) intent to cause the recipient(s) fear that the threat will be carrier out

The fact sheet inconclusively states, that I made full admission to sending the email
and intending John O'Neill to receive it and perceive I would follow through on my
intent. But it negligently omits I made the admissions along with confirmation to taking legal action and no other form of action.

The other amazing representation in the fact sheet is that it says the email states
\`\`\`
"This isn't a game. Your fucking incompetents leaving the rooftop membrane leaking for
multiple years and consistently fumbling strict maintenance duty is fucking up people's
health. I'm coming for you the second I'm feeling healthy enough to pull the trigger."
\`\`\`
I.e. it completely dumps the prior sentence and context
\`\`\`
"You may choose to ignore me
again, but it will be shown in court, you have been warned these things have burrowed
through boundary walls"
\`\`\`

I did not admit intent to send only half of the email, which is what the full facts
insinuates. Nor that I warned Jr. that considering the phrase in isolation completely
out of reasonable context was inappropriate and biased. The full facts almost 180
degrees, misrepresents my exchange with Constable Jr.

This is what I was trying to convey the actually meaning when looking at the whole email
and not two sentences chosen to be re-imagine with new meaning.

> Pathology of the Infectious Diseases department at St Vincents has confirmed these to be sacks of Cockroach eggs. They are know to cause Asthma and Eczema and various other ailments. <ins>my concern for the problem: O'Neill Strata management's conduct is compromising  our building's health and SAFETY</ins>

> You may choose to ignore me again, but it will be shown in court, you have been warned these things have burrowed through boundary walls. <ins>explicitly discusses my intent to attend to pursue the matter **via court**</ins>

> This isn't a game. Your fucking incompetents leaving the rooftop membrane leaking for multiple years and consistently fumbling strict maintenance duty is fucking up people's health. <ins>Expresses their legally bound conduct as a serious matter in breach of  their duty.</ins>

> I'm coming for you the second I'm feeling healthy enough to pull the trigger. <ins>is my intended time-line</ins>


## Not allowing submission of evidence

If the policeman would have given me a chance, I could have down him the whole email
thread which actually has me explicitly mentioning to the new chairperson, that
***I've been too sick to submit my NCAT application***.

The Irony of everything is that the actual email thread is about my concern for
health and safety of occupants in the building, which John O'Neill is demonstrating
he does not care for. But he clearly worries about his own "safety". Additionally
the police had no concern for the fact I mentioned I wasn't feeling well at the
beginning of my interaction with Constable Jr.

I have invested literally months preparing to recover financial losses
by learning Strata legislation and researching recent NSW Strata case law. It makes
no sense, that I would compromise this path with violent acts that could harm my
chances of recovering financial losses.

This isn't the first time John O'Neill has defamed me publicly as demonstrated
in his labeled me "unfinacial" to all my neighbors when I'd paid my levies. He is not
a truthful man and I am able to demonstrate other instances of him providing
misinformation.

<!-- ### Incorrectly alleged violent or harassing intent

a. Sentences preceding (giving meaning not personally imaged and logically proving violent intent a nonsensical interpretation),
b. The nature and content of the whole email thread (explicitly highlighting litigation as intent and coloring O'Neill misconduct)
c. The emails I was planning to submit as evidence offering clarity around choice of language, the nature of the email thread itself and long history of prior misconduct
 -->

<!-- > ## Summary
*Each point is enough to introducing reasonable doubt.*
1. **Unsound re-imaged meaning** of partial message
  - Cultural consensus on "Pull the trigger" definitions and usage
  - I intended sending the whole email not half, one phrase or a single sentence
  - Illogical implications of pick and choose quoting
  - Actual word by word contextual intended meaning of my own email
2. **Ignoring prior explicit declarations** to litigate (seek resolution within the law)
3. **Vast prior non-violent conduct** in chronic extenuating Strata dispute
  - Using "carriage service" and Internet for proposed innovative Strata solution
  - Hyper vigilant interest in law, Strata legislation and recent Case law/verdicts
  - Focus on recovering of financial losses suffered by Strata maintenance failure
4. **Examples of O'Neill conduct**
  - Pattern of misinformation and false claims against my name
  - Disregard for laws
  - Disregard for occupant health and safety
 -->
<!-- ### An unsound interpretation
 -->
<!--
##### The entire thread chronologically

The first important fact of the timeline is O'Neill ignored my my correspondence and concern for pest control, which they are contractually and legislatively responsible to answer as part of Owners Corporation Secretarial duty and duty to not causing nuisance or compromising Safety of occupants.

<!-- #### Prior conduct during Strata dispute

##### My background and conduct

[Personal Context](jk) will quickly help you see technology, commerce, creating wealth and innovative software concepts using "carriage service" and always been my only intent. I admit, frustrating [circumstances at home](lot36) have been hard not to express. My [Strata dispute resolution skin](resolution) is thick. In the context of hundreds of hours invested on non-violent optimistic acts, it's clear, course language is just frustrations and stress.

##### False allegations stacking up

##### John O'Neill conduct

5. The allegation was exceptionally unfair, in context that if anyone had being harassed, I could demonstrate circumstance and more literal evidence of such incidence against me by related parties.

So I shall demonstrate the unsoundness of this view one step at a time:

##### Abets
encourage or assist (someone) to do something wrong, in particular, to commit a crime or other offense.


##### Acquittal
The legal and formal certification of the innocence of a person who has been charged with a crime.


##### Annulling
declare invalid (an official agreement, decision, or result).


##### Adjournment
The suspension of a hearing until a further date that is usually specified. Either party may apply for an adjournment, but it is the decision of the magistrate or judge as to whether or not it will be granted.


##### Affidavit
A signed and sworn statement prepared for a court.


##### ANTECEDENT
1. Antecedent means earlier, pre-existing or previous. Any preceding thing or the quality or fact of being before. 
2. Something that goes before. In the construction of laws, agreements, and the like, reference is always to be made to the last antecedent; ad proximun antecedens fiat relatio. But not only the antecedents but the subsequent clauses of the instrument must be considered: Ex antecedentibus et consequentibus fit optima interpretatio. 


##### Common law
The common law, or judge-made law, is made up of cases that have interpreted the statutory law. For this information you'll need to go to the Commonwealth and State law reports, but useful summaries are contained in some basic law manuals. The most valuable of these are loose-leaf services, which are updated as legislative amendments are made and usually spell out the elements of each charge.


Committal
    If you are charged with a serious offence, a preliminary hearing is often held before a magistrate to decide if the matter should go to trial. This is the 'committal hearing' where the prosecution must test its case, and the magistrate must either discharge the accused, or commit her or him to trial. 


##### Fiduciary
An individual in whom another has placed the utmost trust and confidence to manage and protect property or money. The relationship wherein one person has an obligation to act for another's benefit.


##### Garnishee
a third party who is served notice by a court to surrender money in settlement of a debt or claim.
"a garnishee order"


##### Injunction
a judicial order that restrains a person from beginning or continuing an action threatening or invading the legal right of another, or that compels a person to carry out a certain act, e.g., to make restitution to an injured party.


##### Indictable offence
an offence which can only be tried on an indictment after a preliminary hearing to determine whether there is a prima facie case to answer or by a grand jury.


##### Pecuniary
relating to or consisting of money.


##### Prejudice
harm or injury that results or may result from some action or judgment.

##### Prejudicial
Causing or tending to cause harm, especially to a legal case: a prejudicial error.
Showing or full of prejudice; biased: a prejudicial opinion.


#### Prima facie
Latin expression meaning on its first encounter or at first sight. The literal translation would be "at first face" or "at first appearance"


##### Probate notice,


##### Subpoena
Being before the court on a charge allows you to use some of the authority of the court to force disclosure of evidence. For instance, you may wish to subpoena (call for) a police officer's notebook, to check against her or his statement; or you may subpoena police, governmental or private records relating to an action you were involved in.
A subpoena may also require that a person appear in court to give evidence, or to produce relevant documents. It may, however, be risky to subpoena people to give evidence if you don't have a statement from them – you cannot predict the evidence they will give, and it may not all be helpful to your case.


##### Statute
Law students and attorneys must master the art of legal citation. Legal citation refers to the proper reference of cases, statutes and other legal authorities. Statutes are laws enacted by state legislatures or by Congress. Citing statutes can pose problems because laws are often found in several forms -- session laws, bills and codes -- and you can find the same law in several forms. Law schools and courts adopt several style guides to ensure that lawyers and students cite statutes in a uniform manner.`; set['keen'] = `Minister,
Thanks for spending you Saturday morning in a heated, almost hostile, but I believe underneath to be well meaning and admirably grass rooted forum. Thank you also for listening to my question to learn more of your thought process and current initiatives to deal with the current environment created a long historical evolution of what is current Strata law and the systems and industry surrounding. I was the young recently returned to Sydney Silicon Valley techie in the last row with laptop and wireless headphones. This was the first OCN event. Even though I'd never met a single person in the room prior to this morning, I want to apologize on their behalf. I appreciate their pain first hand and immediately recognize their skin worn down, no longer thick enough to compose and engage you productively in such manner you can easily understand  appreciate, repackage and present on their behalf amongst juggling so many diverse concerns amongst the vast body of people you represent. 

I was glad to observe and appreciate your commitment in wanting to do so, with small but obvious gestures like wanting to answer as many questions as time permitted, whist the room was unfortunately squabbling over what is appropriate conduct. I made suggestion to Karen for your next OCN event to disallow open questions. Instead members should submit clearly articulated written queries to be shared with your office ahead of time so we can work together to reach understanding and forward motion every-time you commit your time. I too wish for the same thing from my own invested Saturday mornings!

I'm not sure many understood what I was trying to get across and think a few jumped to the incorrect assumption, I was like a few others speaking to complain (that I couldn't understand the law) and needed your help. While perhaps the latter is true, only in the sense that I think there are some very deep legislated misalignments and unnecessary complexity. I'm interested in participating in driving the evolution of Strata law to stop situations like my own from reoccurring. One element I wish to publish think pieces online about is how complicated and unrealistic expectation for people to represent themselves in the framework of the current SSMA15 legislation. Understanding the following law and enactment and industry around it has taken me close to 18 months full time:

Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act
Electronic Transactions Legislation Amendment (Government Transactions) Act 2017 No 25
Property, Stock and Business Agents Act 2002 No 66
Property, Stock and Business Agents Regulation 2014
Property Stock Agents Regulation 2018
Strata Schemes Development Act 2015 No 51
Strata Schemes Management Act 2015 No 50
Strata Schemes Management Regulation 2016
Work Health and Safety Act 2011

I've yet to wrap my head around:

Dividing Fences Act 
Environment Planning & Assessment Act
Environment Planning & Assessment Regulation
Fair Trading Act
Home Building Act 2014
Home Building Regulation 2014
Home Building Amendment (Compensation Reform) Act 2017 No 28

I truly believe the government invited consumers to climb and unclimbable path. I have controversial questions like "Was this architected by mistake or intention?". I'm glad to hear and very intrigued by your initiatives like the coming Fair trading portal. Fair Trading mediation was a very detrimental waste of time in my circumstance in which the parties could not agree on representatives to negotiate. Unfortunately, I was unable in this morning's environment to grasp what/how with Fair Trading you want to help "mom and pop" take on the big guys. I have so many small to gigantic, conservative to radical, simple to extreme cutting edge tech concepts to fix this picture.

It was fantastic to read about you cracking down on Strata Agents ripping of OCs with non-transparent, unreasonable fees. In reality there's still a gap that you have got on your radar. There's almost nothing via NCAT/SSMA I can do with my doggy Strata Agent, responsible for extensive unmanaged concrete cancer and leaving my apartment uninhabitable now approaching 2 years. Perhaps the PSBA Compensation fund is a more appropriate course. I don't know if the various lawyers I tried did not make the suggestion because they don't even know about it or it's not really in effect.

It's fascinating to see a government encourage consumers towards self representation and industry resist. I was trying to arrive this morning at:

(1) Will the law be made simpler so that vision of self-representation can be successfully realized or;
(2) Will government stimulate industry to align and achieve harmony (I think that's what you are saying you are working on, do you really think you can pull it off, what do you see as the biggest challenges? I see many...but opportunities for employment and potential application of emerging economic marketplace/gig income models) or; (3) Will no dramatic policies be put in effect and situations like my personal strata hell saga propagate as quickly as the coming exponential growth of the sector (and its constituents)?

I was running a $2M funded on-demand consultants Start-up in San Francisco before buying my Grandma's Bondi Apartment. Finding it was full of concrete cancer too late and falling into complicated entangled legalities has set me on a new path with so much I wish to see changed. From my first impression today, I think that's what you want too and passionately disagree with the MC commenting you have an impossible job. We can made a big impact with consistent unwaivering dedication. But introducing new ideas, whether for profit in tech or setting new hight via government in living standards takes time and resolve. Nobody takes a job like yours to continually absorb heat (hopefully not at every appearance) without deep motivation helping to brush it off chaff and continually focus on the things that matter.`; set['levy'] = `===============================================================================

# Strata Managing Agent misconduct

<!-- "1626fdd335564b31"
Our tenant in unit 2 has emailed that they arrived home last night to find water surcharching out of the bathroom floor waste to the hallway and lounge room and then to bedroom.

The tenant called your three strata plumbers 3 times each and no-one answered their phones or called the tenants back.

The tenants therefore called our emergency plumber who attended the site from 1.00 am to 3.00 am and jet blasted the blocked sewer stack and rectified the issue. -->

## Metaphor

"Main isolation valve leak"
