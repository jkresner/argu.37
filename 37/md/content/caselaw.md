Habits of Highly Effective Tribunal Members
1. They remember that this case is a very important event for the applicant
What for the tribunal member may be the umpteenth case of the same kind that they are
dealing with, in most cases is the ONLY case that is important to the applicant. In many, if
not most cases, it will be the first time the applicant has had contact with the justice system
or appeared in a court or tribunal.
Effective tribunal members do not assume that the applicant has an understanding of what
is likely to happen in the proceedings, the role of the tribunal member or the issues that
must be determined.
Effective tribunal members appreciate that more often than not the applicant will be
apprehensive and nervous. They will have developed techniques to put the applicant at
ease. 
2
When sitting in a narrow jurisdiction the effective member will guard against appearing to
be bored or to have “heard it all before”.
2. They identify in advance the key issues to be determined
Preparation is the key to an effective hearing. It requires thorough knowledge of the
relevant legislation, relevant authorities and the tests to be determined. In addition, it
requires careful consideration of the available material, even where it is voluminous and
apparently irrelevant. It is not uncommon for a self-represented applicant who is unable to
identify the issues to be determined, to “throw everything into the pot” and bury
information that could assist their case.
Careful preparation enhances a tribunal member’s ability to conduct an effective hearing.
As Justice Garry Downes AM, former President of the AAT pointed out, it will make your job
easier, give you more satisfaction and, importantly, increase the likelihood of achieving the
ultimate goal: making the right decision.1
3. They are aware of the bias rule
“Justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be
done”: R v Sussex Justices; ex parte McCarthy [1924] 1 KB 256 per Lord Hewart CJ.
The English comic “Beachcomber”, who had apparently observed some unusual judicial
behaviour, put a useful slant on this maxim: “Justice must not only be done, it must be seen
to be believed.”
The test of apprehended bias is well-known: “[W]hether a fair-minded lay observer might
reasonably apprehend that the judge might not bring an impartial and unprejudiced mind to
the resolution of the question the judge is required to decide”.
2
The bias rule is intended
both to ensure fair hearings and to ensure the reputation of the justice system.
The rule against bias requires tribunal members to approach their task with an open mind.
This is not necessarily an empty one. It is permissible to bring knowledge and experience to
a case. The question is always one of degree and context.3
A tribunal member’s reputation for efficiency and fairness takes time to earn but can be
quickly lost. The pages of “Justinian” are full of stories of judges and lawyers behaving
badly. And the legal profession is full of gossips.



Foss v Harbottle
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foss_v_Harbottle


There are certain exceptions to the rule in Foss v. Harbottle, where litigation will be allowed. The following exceptions protect basic minority rights, which are necessary to protect regardless of the majority's vote.

1. Ultra vires and illegality
The directors of a company, or a shareholding majority may not use their control of the company to paper over actions which would be ultra vires the company, or illegal.

s 39 Companies Act 2006 for the rules on corporate capacity
Smith v Croft (No 2) and Cockburn v. Newbridge Sanitary Steam Laundry Co. [1915] 1 IR 237, 252-59 (per O'Brien LC and Holmes LJ) for the illegality point
2. Actions requiring a special majority
If some special voting procedure would be necessary under the company's constitution or under the Companies Act, it would defeat both if that could be sidestepped by ordinary resolutions of a simple majority, and no redress for aggrieved minorities to be allowed.

Edwards v Halliwell [1950] 2 All ER 1064
3. Invasion of individual rights
Pender v Lushington (1877) 6 Ch D 70, per Jessel MR
...and see again, Edwards v Halliwell [1950] 2 All ER 1064

4. "Frauds on the minority"
Atwool v Merryweather (1867) LR 5 EQ 464n, per Page Wood VC
Gambotto v WCP Limited (1995) 182 CLR 432 (Aus)
Daniels v Daniels (1978)
fraud in the context of derivative action means abuse of power whereby the directors or majority, who are in control of the company, secure a benefit at the expense of the company

...and see Greenhalgh v Arderne Cinemas Ltd for an example of what was not a fraud on the minority


'derivative action', which allows a minority shareholder to bring a claim on behalf of the company. This applies in situations of 'wrongdoer control' and is, in reality, the only true exception to the rule.
