Minister,
Thanks for spending you Saturday morning in a heated, almost hostile, but I believe underneath to be well meaning and admirably grass rooted forum. Thank you also for listening to my question to learn more of your thought process and current initiatives to deal with the current environment created a long historical evolution of what is current Strata law and the systems and industry surrounding. I was the young recently returned to Sydney Silicon Valley techie in the last row with laptop and wireless headphones. This was the first OCN event. Even though I'd never met a single person in the room prior to this morning, I want to apologize on their behalf. I appreciate their pain first hand and immediately recognize their skin worn down, no longer thick enough to compose and engage you productively in such manner you can easily understand  appreciate, repackage and present on their behalf amongst juggling so many diverse concerns amongst the vast body of people you represent. 

I was glad to observe and appreciate your commitment in wanting to do so, with small but obvious gestures like wanting to answer as many questions as time permitted, whist the room was unfortunately squabbling over what is appropriate conduct. I made suggestion to Karen for your next OCN event to disallow open questions. Instead members should submit clearly articulated written queries to be shared with your office ahead of time so we can work together to reach understanding and forward motion every-time you commit your time. I too wish for the same thing from my own invested Saturday mornings!

I'm not sure many understood what I was trying to get across and think a few jumped to the incorrect assumption, I was like a few others speaking to complain (that I couldn't understand the law) and needed your help. While perhaps the latter is true, only in the sense that I think there are some very deep legislated misalignments and unnecessary complexity. I'm interested in participating in driving the evolution of Strata law to stop situations like my own from reoccurring. One element I wish to publish think pieces online about is how complicated and unrealistic expectation for people to represent themselves in the framework of the current SSMA15 legislation. Understanding the following law and enactment and industry around it has taken me close to 18 months full time:

Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act
Electronic Transactions Legislation Amendment (Government Transactions) Act 2017 No 25
Property, Stock and Business Agents Act 2002 No 66
Property, Stock and Business Agents Regulation 2014
Property Stock Agents Regulation 2018
Strata Schemes Development Act 2015 No 51
Strata Schemes Management Act 2015 No 50
Strata Schemes Management Regulation 2016
Work Health and Safety Act 2011

I've yet to wrap my head around:

Dividing Fences Act 
Environment Planning & Assessment Act
Environment Planning & Assessment Regulation
Fair Trading Act
Home Building Act 2014
Home Building Regulation 2014
Home Building Amendment (Compensation Reform) Act 2017 No 28

I truly believe the government invited consumers to climb and unclimbable path. I have controversial questions like "Was this architected by mistake or intention?". I'm glad to hear and very intrigued by your initiatives like the coming Fair trading portal. Fair Trading mediation was a very detrimental waste of time in my circumstance in which the parties could not agree on representatives to negotiate. Unfortunately, I was unable in this morning's environment to grasp what/how with Fair Trading you want to help "mom and pop" take on the big guys. I have so many small to gigantic, conservative to radical, simple to extreme cutting edge tech concepts to fix this picture.

It was fantastic to read about you cracking down on Strata Agents ripping of OCs with non-transparent, unreasonable fees. In reality there's still a gap that you have got on your radar. There's almost nothing via NCAT/SSMA I can do with my doggy Strata Agent, responsible for extensive unmanaged concrete cancer and leaving my apartment uninhabitable now approaching 2 years. Perhaps the PSBA Compensation fund is a more appropriate course. I don't know if the various lawyers I tried did not make the suggestion because they don't even know about it or it's not really in effect.

It's fascinating to see a government encourage consumers towards self representation and industry resist. I was trying to arrive this morning at:

(1) Will the law be made simpler so that vision of self-representation can be successfully realized or;
(2) Will government stimulate industry to align and achieve harmony (I think that's what you are saying you are working on, do you really think you can pull it off, what do you see as the biggest challenges? I see many...but opportunities for employment and potential application of emerging economic marketplace/gig income models) or; (3) Will no dramatic policies be put in effect and situations like my personal strata hell saga propagate as quickly as the coming exponential growth of the sector (and its constituents)?

I was running a $2M funded on-demand consultants Start-up in San Francisco before buying my Grandma's Bondi Apartment. Finding it was full of concrete cancer too late and falling into complicated entangled legalities has set me on a new path with so much I wish to see changed. From my first impression today, I think that's what you want too and passionately disagree with the MC commenting you have an impossible job. We can made a big impact with consistent unwavering dedication. But introducing new ideas, whether for profit in Tech or setting new hight via government in living standards takes time and resolve. Nobody takes a job like yours to continually absorb heat (hopefully not at every appearance) without deep motivation helping to brush it off chaff and continually focus on the things that matter.
