Common
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Adduce
To present, offer, bring forward, or introduce (evidence).

### Balance of probabilities         
The case that is the more probable should succeed. This is the kind of decision represented by the scales of justice. The court weighs up the evidence and decides which version is most probably true.

#### Acquittal
The legal and formal certification of the innocence of a person who has been charged with a crime.

#### Committal
If you are charged with a serious offence, a preliminary hearing is often held before a magistrate to decide if the matter should go to trial. This is the 'committal hearing' where the prosecution must test its case, and the magistrate must either discharge the accused, or commit her or him to trial. 

### Indictable offence
Offence which can only be tried on an indictment after a preliminary hearing to determine whether there is a prima facie case to answer or by a grand jury.

### Subpoena
Being before the court on a charge allows you to use some of the authority of the court to force disclosure of evidence. For instance subpoena (call for) a officer's notebook, police, governmental or private records relating to an action you were involved in.

Disposing of proceedings

####  Impropriety
1. The quality or condition of being improper.
2. An improper act.
3. An improper or unacceptable usage in speech or writing.


### Ultra vires 
Latin phrase meaning "beyond the powers". If an act requires legal authority and it is done with such authority, it is characterised in law as intra vires ("within the powers"). If it is done without such authority, it is ultra vires. Acts that are intra vires may equivalently be termed "valid" and those that are ultra vires "invalid".






##### Beyond reasonable doubt
It has been described, in negative terms, as a proof having been met if there is no plausible reason to believe otherwise. If there is a real doubt, based upon reason and common sense after careful and impartial consideration of all the evidence, or lack of evidence, in a case, then the level of proof has not been met. 
It does not mean that no doubt exists as to the accused's guilt, but only that no reasonable doubt is possible from the evidence presented.


##### Inducement
1. Contracting: Advantage, benefit, or consideration that causes a party to enter into a binding agreement, or motivates it to perform more efficiently and cost effectively.
2. Law: (1) Persuasion by enticement, threat, or urging to commit a crime or pursue a particular course of action. It is practically impossible to clearly differentiate between the legal meanings of advice, enticement, inducement, and procurement. (2) Statement of preliminary facts presented to establish the criminal nature of an alleged offense.




##### Prejudice
harm or injury that results or may result from some action or judgement.

##### Prejudicial
Causing or tending to cause harm, especially to a legal case: a prejudicial error.
Showing or full of prejudice; biased: a prejudicial opinion.






### Statute
Statutes are laws enacted by state legislatures or by Congress. Citing statutes can pose problems because laws are often found in several forms -- session laws, bills and codes -- and you can find the same law in several forms. Law schools and courts adopt several style guides to ensure that lawyers and students cite statutes in a uniform manner.
