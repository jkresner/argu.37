Could you please be VERY precise about who you are referring to regarding "our 
client The owners of SP13385". I have clearly stated the illegal elements in 
this ledger and I require the individuals that instruct you to ignore my request 
to wait for decision at NCAT after ignoring formal mediation application and
bring this discussion fairly to the owners corporation at general meeting.

I have no issue paying the amount allegedly owed nor protest the nature of 
paying Strata levies.

I am the owner - above all others - that has the greatest entitlement, 
financial interest and ongoing contributions to protect. As such it has always 
been my natural position to want best for the full constituents comprising 
"the owners of SP13385" and remove every element exposing personal liability. 

This offer (requiring response and valid until end of day today) is made to
mitigate mistaken defaming conduct escalating SP13385 unlimited financial risk.

> I will deposit $15,000 to be held in escrow trust account of my lawyer available 
> to be distributed after in progress NCAT application lawfully resolves the
> multiple technical issues in this ledger already documented with ignored 
> attempts to resolve by 2017 AGM agenda notice and Fair Trading mediation. 
> In accepting this offer all constituents and agents of SP13385 will cease 
> defamatory behavior including, but not limited to withholding voting right 
> and minuting lot 36 unfinancial, effective immediately.

We refer to your email of today’s date and have sought instructions from our 
client in respect of your email dated 17 August 2018.
 
Your offer is rejected and we have instructions to commence legal recovery 
action against you on the expiry of the time period stipulated in our previous 
Letter of Demand and Notice of Action.  We expect your lawyer will advise you
that your separate complaints do not excuse your liability for strata levy 
contributions and related costs owing to our client.

1. Following recent correspondence between the parties our client instructed us to commence legal recovery action against you pertaining to outstanding levy contributions and related costs under the Strata Schemes Management Act 2015.  You will certainly be given an opportunity to defend those proceedings should you wish to do so and the process by which that can be attended to is explained on the Statement of Claim which is the originating Court process setting out the background to the claim and how the amounts sought are calculated. 
 
2. We would invite you to agree to accept service of the afore-mentioned Statement of Claim by email, which is an accepted mode of service, by agreement between the parties.  In this respect we would be please if you would advise us of your agreement to do so within seven (7) days from today. 
 
3. If agreement cannot be reached for service by email, our client would be entitled to file a further Court process, known as a Notice of Motion, seeking orders for this mode of service and would have no option but to see to recover from you the costs of that application, should that be necessary.  Our client would instruct us to rely on the contents of this communication if the need arises to do so.
 
4. We await your response within seven (7) days from the date hereof and thank you in advance for your co-operation.

I don't know what you’re on about yet and because of your relentless ongoing 
vexatious legal harassment had to adjourn the criminal hearing yesterday your 
client instigated instead of pest treating and maintaining a no hazard safe 
environment. What are you seriously thinking threatening me again last Thursday?

With a 7 day deadline! Wow that had the effected you wanted don't worry.

For you information i also missed the window to see my Lyme Doctor/specialist 
because of the last set of email intimidation and lost sleep.

You are significantly drawing out and increasing losses SP13385 will have to 
cover. I wish for myself and them that you disappear so that the core issues 
can be attended as quickly as possible.

Dear Mr Kresner,
We attach the following documents by way of service on you:

· Statement of Claim issued by the Local Court on 27 September 2018 in Case No. 2018/00295744; and
· Notice of Orders Made by the Local Court on 22 October 2018.


1. We refer to your emails received on 10 October 2018.  We sympathise with your predicament, but do not accept that our client could be responsible for the situation you reference.
 
2. The seven day time period is because the court expects the parties to use their best endeavours to progress matters. The time period we seek is reasonable.
 
3. Please respond within 24 hours to our request for your agreement to accept service of a court process by electronic mail, or nominate a solicitor (with appropriate address and contact details) who might be able to accept service on your behalf.  This would reduce the costs for both parties.
 
We thank you in advance for your co-operation and await a response within 24 hours.

Please refer to attached - Notice of Motion to Set Aside Default Judgment. Defence will be presented in court in the New Year. 

Please confirm no further action regarding credit/enforcement will be taken at this juncture and you accept notice by email as being served appropriately (since I don't have David Le Page’s email address handy).

As I understand, a new Strata Agent and committee member has been appointed. Should the owners corporation be in the mindset to begin minimizing the continually growing amount of damages being sought and upcoming time spent in various proceedings (all surrounding the same core issues) - I am open to another final attempt at dialog.
