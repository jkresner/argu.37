  \n- This application was received on 9 May 2018. The applicant is Jonathon Kresner, owner of unit 36. The respondent is the owners corporation SP13385.
  \n- Mediator Natalie Witjes tried to arrange a mediation. The parties have been unable to agree on mutually acceptable terms on which to mediate in relation to the persons nominated to attend mediation on behalf of the owners corporation.
