'1641b484f19ca1ed': { d:1, f: 'fa', md: `Review of the Brief of Evidence
\nIn respect of our review of the brief of evidence, I have indicated that this will cost $880.00 (including GST). I have attached our firm’s Cost Agreement for your execution.  \nTo get the ball rolling, I will need you to do the following:
\n1. Sign the cost agreement that is attached;  \n2. Transfer $880 to our firm’s Trust Account (see page 5 of the Cost Agreement); and  \n3. Send me the brief of evidence you have received for me to review and advise.
\nPlease note that I will be beginning the review as soon as all of the above have occurred.
\nAVO Application  \nAs with most AVO proceedings, it is difficult to advise with great certainty as to how strong your application will be. If the conduct that you are alleging against you has ceased, and there appears to be no ‘current’ fears for your safety, then the legislation states that your application cannot succeed. I will need to review the evidence on which you rely upon for your application before I draft the actual application, as this will allow me to see whether:
\n1. You have a ‘current’ fear for your safety; and \n2. Whether the evidence can amount to harassing, threatening, or intimidating conduct.
\nIf the above can be satisfied, then you will be able to demonstrate on the balance of probabilities your application. Indeed, the initial deposit of $5000 will include our review of your evidence and whether you have strong enough grounds to go forward with the AVO application. I advise that if there are no ‘current’ fears for your safety, then the AVO application will not succeed.
\nI’m happy to have a further conference with you focusing only on the AVO application before you make a decision, but this will cost $220.00.
\nPlease let me know your thoughts Jonathan.
`},
'1641b22a9ccd0647': { d:1, f: 'jk', md: `I would like to proceed on reviewing the brief of evidence immediately.  \nPlease instruct next steps.  \nWith regard to the AVO, I feel I'm being put in a difficult position to commit the deposit, with so little understanding and certainty around success variables at this specific moment in time. I feel the need for a consultation before making the call. I don't have enough information to proceed.`},
'1641b07285bfc077': { d:1, f: 'fa', md: `Firstly, yes – our fees to review and advise on the Brief of Evidence is $880. I don’t think it’s surprising that the brief is straight-forward, as you did indicate in conference that the police were practically clenching at straws. Nonetheless, I can review and advise for that fee.
\nIn respect of the AVO application, as indicated previously, we will need $5000.00 deposited into our firm’s Trust Account before I can commence any work on that. I have attached, for your records and execution, our firm’s Cost Agreement in respect of the AVO Application alone. Please review and execute, then send back to me with the initial payment of $5000.00 to go towards your ongoing legal fees in this matter.
\nI note that you have raised the issue of risk. In AVO matters, the key test under the legislation is whether you currently hold a fear, and in fact fear, for your personal and physical wellbeing and safety from the defendant. If the court finds that your application is frivolous or vexatious, or that you currently don’t hold any real fears for your safety (and rejects your application), you may be liable to pay any legal fees the defendant has paid in respect of defending the matter. Accordingly, you need to proceed with caution when bringing an application such as this because if you are not successful, costs may be ordered against you.
\nAccordingly, if you instruct me that you do not wish to proceed with an AVO against the defendant, that will be the end of it. Our fee of $880 will still be applicable to review and advise you (a second opinion) on the Brief of Evidence from a legal standpoint (noting that you currently have a lawyer).
\nPlease let me know what you would like to do - glad to assist you Jonathan.

'1649548b7ee986d9': { d:1, f: 'jk', md: `When I was 15 I started collecting unopened antique miniature alcohol bottles (50ml). I was too young to buy them myself, so my parents brought them back from overseas trips and plane rides. I also convinced grandparents on both sides to donate bottles from their own liquor cabinets, many of which were already 20-30 years old at the time. I spent weeks negotiating trades over email with collector friends all around the world (Ireland, Scotland, USA, Canada, New Zealand, Israel, Japan...). An incredible amount of attention and extreme care went into carefully packing each bottle to make sure the labels remained in perfect condition and the morning the postman would appear with boxes from overseas were extremely rewarding. From 18-21 I bought every bottle from liquor shops and airport duty free that I didn't yet have. I even attended the world's largest collector gathering one year in Wellington, New Zealand. Eventually I moved/lived overseas and it was too difficult to actively collect, so I left my collection safe and sound for a decade in storage until moving to Paul St. In 2016 I started buying again after enjoying unpacking them all and finding many had appreciated in value to hundreds of dollars each <https://www.whiskybank.com.au/product/johnnie-walker-1820-special-edition-un-boxed-700ml/>. But the real value was my time building the 1000+ collection, consistent effort to maintain each bottle in good condition and most importantly the unique memories like those with my Grandmother Rose that each one represents.
\nIt took a full day to carefully pack them into protective systems and styrophome containers with soft materials layered in between such that no bottle touched/rubbed against another.
\nI am gutted that after storing them inside a closet in my garage and being ignored to repair the leak in the garage more that 5 times, that the mould got so intense it penetrated the closet and containers and realize that not only my whole collection is damaged but basically ALL my personal belongings from childhood and everything I kept including items from deceasd grandparents all ruined - suits, shoes, cloths, electronics, furniture, rugs, art, antiques, sporting equipment, musical instruments.
\nYou inconsiderate people damaged everything I ever owned worth keeping and irreplaceable, you damaged my home, derailed my ability to work, destroyed my rental income stream and stooped so low to even try damage my reputation fictionalising me as the violent villain of Keppelgate. If I get convicted I won't be able to travel to US to continue receiving medical treatment for Lyme disease. As if you haven't made coping with chronic illness hard enough without home and stress free environment to heal these past 18 months. I almost throw up in my mouth when I think of the type of people capable of putting another human through such an experience. If not the title of "all time worste", I've no doubt after familiarizing myself with strata caselaw this is in the top 5 most irresponsible and indecent Strata stories in NSW ever.`},

\n1) I'd like to leave Sydney next week for a few months and if this is possible in context of your recommendation on substantive charge and seeking AVO
\n2) Earlier I mentioned I do not have a fear of violence/direct physical harm from John himself. I do have ongoing health stress/emotional trauma and fear additional indirect physical threat. I would like to discuss if this is relevant.`},
'16467f29c0e396cc': { d:1,f: 'fa', md: `Thank you for your email below. I assume you have read in full my advice in respect of the Brief of Evidence.
\nFirstly, in respect of a potential AVO against O’Neill, we note that the legislative test is that you “must have a current fear, and in fact fear personal harm”. In saying that, and noting that you have asked O’Neill to stop emailing you (to which he has not complied with), you may have grounds for an AVO. However, I note that this fear must be current, and you must in fact fear that he will cause you personal injury. As reiterated to you previously, if he has since stopped harassing you, the court may not see this proving on balance that you need protection against O’Neill through an AVO. Also, there are risks in respect of costs payable by you to O’Neill if you are unsuccessful in the AVO. Unless there are current emails being sent by him (of a threatening or harassing nature), then the AVO does not have a strong chance.
\nSecondly, the costs to switch to SCL are as follows:
\n1. Given the amount of correspondence that would be required with the Police, your old firm, and potentially writing to the police to withdraw the charge before the hearing date: we estimate our fees at $8,000.00 (including GST); and.  \n2. If your matter is listed for Hearing - to attend one-day Local Court hearing: $4,400.00 (including GST).  \n3. So, roughly speaking, from now until finalization of your matter, the costs will be approximately $12,400.00 (inclusive of GST).
\nThirdly, I confirm that if you switch to SCL, you will not be in a position to obtain their costs (if you are found not guilty of the charge).
\nLastly, there may be some initial practical issues as the Prosecution will need to put us up to date of any correspondence between them and your current lawyers. However, given that we have now received the Brief and are aware of the Prosecution case, I cannot imagine that these practical issues cannot be resolved in a swift and efficient telephone call. Nonetheless, if you are comfortable with your current legal representatives, then it will need to be your decision. Generally speaking, no adverse inference can be drawn from you changing legal representation at this stage.
\nI hope this answers your enquires. Any further questions, please let me know. `},

\nYou may be able to offset monies owed to you by the OC if you have a judgment/order but I doubt you can defend the non-payment of levies.   Did you progress your application for s106 damages?
\nYes this is a complicated issue.  The majority of strata cases are in NCAT and decisions are unpublished.  Hence your searches are not yielding results.  The first question is what is the standard expected of a strata manager?   “Reasonable in the circumstances” is of course unhelpful but it is true that all cases turn on their own facts.
\nI doubt a strata committee member, even if s/he has a legal background would be subject to a higher standard than that imposed on a strata manager.
\nWhat is the source for the words: “serving the OC”?  And does ‘legal background’ mean holding a current practising certificate.

\nSpecifically, would you consider writing to (a) our insurer, (b) lawyers being paid for from our insurance emergency $50k legal support, on my behalf to assess what has been disclosed and not and if I hold information that would remove the safety net from the Owners Corporation and very significantly change the perceived nature of control, by the OC in choosing when to comply and not to comply in with Strata legislation in dealings with me
\n\n1. Duty of Disclosure – Tell the insurer and / or insurance broker
\nBefore entering into a contract of general insurance with an insurer, the OC has a duty under the Insurance Contracts Act 1984, to disclose to the insurer every matter that they know, or could reasonably be expected to know, is relevant to the insurer’s decision whether to accept the risk of the insurance and, if so, on what terms.
\nThe OC has the same duty to disclose those matters to the insurer before they renew, extend, vary or reinstate a contract of general insurance.
\nEssentially, the OC has a duty to disclose to the insurer anything that may increase or change the risk at the property.
\nIf changes like these are not disclosed on the insurance schedule, and a claim is made, it is very likely the insurer would deny the claim. Denial in such instances could be based on non-disclosure, particularly if risks like this are outside the insurer’s underwriting guidelines. The insurer could even go so far as to cancel the policy and refund the insurance premium paid. The OC would then be exposed to the costs and outcomes associated with a claim.`},

Wish instead of thoughts below, I was talking about how we could implement 'that thing' cover on your lates show or sharing fundable Strata/HOA-tech ideas with warm investor response here in SF.
\nWeek to week I'm continually moving around. 18 months unable to secure consistent long term lodging/office grinds one down. *Escaping SP13385* hell is my full time job. Current Strata law naturally forces solo owners with problems to be where I don't want to be... at odds with everyone else.
\nJudicial justice is important to owners in such situations as it is the only avenue to demonstrate good will and without it due attention on liability and cause easily shift to scapegoats and blame. Judicial justice is important to all owners of SP13385 because had it been in place, had sabotaging rights between owners to freely and diligently discuss not been in effect, had corrupting of agenda participation and wiping important opinions and conversation from minutes especially my warnings to focus on avoiding such outcomes not been ok, we might not have arrived here. Judicial justice is important even to the *owners responsible, now demanding I pay the most for their mistake refusing to pay the building for half a year* while leaving me out on the street, because the entire OC could defend side to side, instead of exposed from both front and behind.
\nOk Agenda, please consider deeply honest thinking believe important and needing acknowledgment to steer OC away from continuing risk.
\n*General concerns*
- · No date of the notice (ridiculed bringing up this point at AGM)
- · I was served notice properly (to email) with 7 days warning
- · I was not extended right to request agenda items
- · I want to talk to other owners weeks (even a month) before votes. We are being sued because the OC isn't pooling intelligence, instead sabotaging good governance and defaming and ridiculing diligence attempts.
- · Duplicity or "bad faith" is a serious problems at 37 Paul St
- · Omitting/not sharing with owners my Fair Trading mediation application is a serious liabiilty
\n*Agenda*
1a. Contest AGM 2017 minutes (wasn't even served minutes).
1b. Contest hosting fake Strata Manager enacted interim EGMs. There better and cheaper solutions and systems we can put in place to deal with renovations.
2a. Committee meeting notices + minutes + voting records emailed to me please?
2b. Amanda an owner? It reads she has vote in capacity of the committee without interest/vote and entitlement as owner in OC?
2c. The general story or "report' on status with MDP is upsetting
  - · MA / RO'G / CBP created this stupid situation spending more than $3k without resolution or transparency hecking over chump change sucking the builder dry to the point all their workers walked off site and never came back.
  - · Their inexperience and obscurity compromised lifestyle for occupants, rental income for investors and delayed sales yes
  - · WHEN WILL SOMEONE MENTION 36 UNINHABITABLE ALL 2017/2018 and owners exposed to 106(5)
  - · I warned Rick omission are liabilities and cheating people out of knowing the the extent of internal concrete cancer to repair, increasing damage from missing shower and laundry waterproof membranes and general fake it till you make it is serious skeleton. We already have a Lawyer who bought on top damaged magnesite since my concern was expressed in writing.
  - · If the committee hadn't omitted the truth around unit 37, SP13385 may have had a shot at proper capital works planning the remedial works project.
  - · SP13385 can't seriously be still raising special levy's without a 10 year plan?
  - · The delegation of authority explanation makes claims on being best for the OC without basis. The reasons the legislation forces committees to make special resolutions in the exact circumstances is because it is COMPLETELY PRACTICAL for Mary Atkinson to explain how she will use it, before again flushing my money down the toilet.
  - · *** How was/why was a claim to the legal defence policy made without prior resolution at general meeting?
2.d Tenancy concerns
 - Only Mary Atkinson would twist by-laws as just mechanism for common property, while ignoring Special By-Law 7 for 2 years of remedial construction works leaving the OC in the mess and one owner's lot indefinitely uninhabitable with $xM claim. Scary duplicity. Really scary.
\nI'm going to stop here. If you think I should pick up where I left off, please express or better give me reason to believe it is helpful more than hurtful share the rest.

'16551ff6b606910c': {d:1, f: 'jk', md: `Had a quick skim, I will do a thorough review in a day or two. Quick concerns:
\n
1. I'm not sure if your child safety By-law is meant to be SBL 17 or 18 ?
2. Wondering how the committee members changed without general meeting notice / procedure / vote?
3. Ignoring a moment, I will shortly attempt order for all 13385 Special by-laws be repealed on basis of fraud, here are practical concerns from 37 paul st experiences you will become intimate with:
  a. The SBLs are out of hand in terms of complex legal verbiage and length. These characteristic inhibit:
    - · distribution
    - · getting the scheme to understand and care for what by-laws are and how we should utilize them
    - · ability of parties to commit required attention to learn and respect (theoretically talking about non-owners, but historically strata agent and committee)
    - · self abiding / enforcing scheme management (OC will be humiliated in district court in defending lot36 alleged ledger)
    - · risk/liability limitation
  b. There's a bunch of useless shit which should have been repealed in 1996, at least last year for Nov compliance and not proposed in the first place by SSM s139 conflict
    - · e.g. SBL security restrictions contradict SSM15
    - · SBL renovation by-laws swindling OC responsibilities onto owners desperate and not patient like me to wait for OC to fix CP items consistently for everyone
  c. Everything people need to know should fit on preferably 2 x A4 but IMHO no more than 4 x A4 paper and permanently stuck on noticeboard mounted in the lift
    - · sticky taping paper randomly in the lift and front door is not cool
    - · failing to handle notices and disclosures about meetings legal disputes and proposed actions must cease
    - · definitions should be handled without duplication causing the need for intense scrutiny of implication and understanding of old acts (basically you and I, not sure based on history but maybe rick - would pay enough attention)
    - · renovation process and documentation should be streamlined and throughly collected and kept in a separate mechanism with a by-law referring to it as scheme law consistently applied to owners (memorandum to be one part).

4. At first I thought MDP/Belmont was mainly responsible for the remedial works disaster
   a. Whilst both parties made a lot of mistakes, I collated evidence to suggest SC17 (2017 Strata Committee) are significantly more at fault and
     - · Believe the OC will most likely loose any action by MDP brought against the SP13385 owners for compromising on BCA in multiple instructions voiding warranty
     - · Fear if I am called to testify or provide evidence SP13385 will be totally helpless
     - · Will seek to recover my % entitlement contribution to any legal fees related to the remedial works
   b. With regard to the structure of this resolution and historical conduct around governance and authority over usage of OC funds
     - · Very strongly contest the right to access legal funds without strict ongoing transparency, updates/disclosure and continuous authorizing meetings/resolutions
     - · Fear the funds could be appropriated to defend my (?related) action against SP13385 without acceptable owner disclosure/resolution
5. Insist from this point all votes are tallied by documented participants and result by aggregate entitlement
6. Attached is recent report of slab condition in my apartement and older Belmont balustrade report (requesting you do not share the report contents or these final bullet items from me to you personally until I explicitly expressing I've changed my mind and you may pass them on agents/suppliers of SP13385 or owner not your husband)
  - · I appreciate you sharing this agenda and in good faith return favor (I had growing fear imagining what topics would be covered)
  - · I would like you to make an audio recording of the EGM meeting. If you are unable, to let me know so I can arrange a lawyer present on my behalf (and cost to be recovered from OC)
  - · Think you should not omit, what I believe to be at the detriment to most owners the nature of and that I am taking legal action against SP13385
  - · Consider carefully that my losses/damages are many multiples the figure disputed with MDP are mentioned "on the cards" in numerous correspondence prior your arrival
  - · Currently seeking protection from ongoing mistreatment by alleging fraud, forgery, embezzlement, harassment, defamation, disregard for safety/hazardous maintenance contravention AND every other problem I've seen, no matter distruptive and expensive to attend, like replacing all balustrades as soon as possible.
  - · Personally pray you find strategy to direct liability away from yourself and owners that did not contribute or actively sabotage my efforts to mitigate losses/OC liability
  - · Believe immediately removing O'Neill is one of your best options
  - · Do not allow awarded damages to be paid out of OC insurance making ongoing yearly contributions sky rocket for everyone not involved
  - · Quickly de-escaate my very immediate and extreme need to emotionally and financially protect myself from defamation and false allegations sorry about spelling / gramma, personal weak point. I spent 3 hours and ran out of laptop battery sharing thoughts that may not net benefit myself. I am comfortable telling you I have so much to cover in court, I don't perceive showing these few cards as impacting the outcome of OC strategy to continue head on resistance vs conceding mistakes and reestablish safe environment to collaborate and repair CP to curb month on month losses.

\n1) The OC is organizing a EGM 22nd August. If there is any strategy / action you want to field in context of this meeting, I'd be happy to discuss.
\n2) Should we go to court, in legal terms our competition will be:
  - I'm guessing LePage (from my research it's a formidable firm re Strata Law)
  - Amongst owners a barrister who was OC chairman <http://www.mpchambers.net.au/barristers/ogorman-hughes.html> 2011-2017 and Amanda Farmer <http://www.lawyerschambers.com.au> who uncannily moved in joining SP13385 as an owner in Feb 2018.
\n3) My sentiment is I don't care who does the legal intimidating I won't allow myself being bullied like below (and a repeat attempt last week sending you too).
\n4) It sums up to needing to know as much as possible about Strata law as well as some risk taking. I replied to LePage back in April knowing specific items had already set precedence stopping Owners Corporations taking action on unpaid levies. I would also have been ok being taken to court to see if a judge out would make a decision I feel against the spirit of SSMAct. I see the situation of an OwnersCorp making a lot uninhabitable, causing losses that would have many times over covered the disputed Strata ledger as an impractical loop hole of removing specific owners against their will, and a decision in court over the fees in the event they could not be paid as a claim under 106(5) anyway. In my case I would have immediately complied with the court and paid and then moved onto 106(5).

  - My ability to engage other owners in constructive pre-meeting discussions have been actively suppressed
  - My very sincere, laborious and extreme time/effort in agenda contributions were turned against me with foul play by O'Niell
    - O'Neill took my requested AGM items (attached) and put them the end after rewrite our AGM agenda stealing my ideas as their own items first
  - At multiple meetings I have been bullied without accountability due to;
  - Neither accurate nor full minute composition:
    - Missing important manners discussed
    - Excluding all item/information not positively reflecting the Strata Manager or Strata Committee
    - Removing late items not discussed properly because the meeting agenda was not appropriate for the time allotment (coincidentally my items have always been last)
    - Who was financial (have been defamed and voting rights withheld when levies were paid)
    - Denied right by O'Neill to raise concern over the minutes to the OC with
        - Not sending notice of Meetings per legislative requirement (to my email)
        - Holding fake proxy-overloading interim EGM's where O'Neill ratifies their own minutes
        - Omitting my formally requested 2017/12AGM20 agenda item to properly ratify minutes
        - At the AGM denying my right to raise objection under continuing illegal pretence of unfinacial status.
\nAttached is an example of pre-meeting effort I made. I setup a google group, invited the Strata Committee (by email), posted a topic and gave my two cents. Unfortunately O'Niell on more than 10 occasions has denied my legal right to the email addresses of the other owners and effectively has been engaged in sabotage of scheme self governance. My NCAT application is covering much more than rental losses. I've done EVERYTHING constructive that I could have to minimise the derailing of personal life including trying to fix SP13385. I even put together a 3 year analysis of plumbing issues and offered to write the capital works plan for the SC in January. The reality is an unfortunately one of denial and negligence, in which my efforts have been made on deaf ears.
\nAm I making a sensible decision trying again with you here? Or is it im the best interest not continuing to spend the time I should have running my own company trying to get SP13385 up to scratch and compliant only to find myself either ignored or defamed and fraudulently represented to the Police in effort to continue covering up malpractice?`},

It is a matter for you how you choose to treat our communications in this matter.  That is unless we expressly mark such communications as private and confidential.  \n
Our instructions are not to communicate with you in the form of debating the matters you have raised. You will be given the opportunity to defend any legal recovery action in due course.`},

\nI will be attempting to contact the Police hopefully today when I get out of court, however I am yet to receive any correspondence/email/call from the Police despite my details being given to them at court on the last occasion.  \n
\nNonetheless, this is relatively normal, and Police will often contact us to make sure all is going ahead with the hearing and/or particulars are answered.  \n
\nI have reviewed your emails in full, and on the basis of the attachments, it may be worthwhile to begin drafting the AVO now. I am aware that your short-term lease was had expired and that you had to move to another temporary accommodation/office.  \n
\nIn respect of strategy, firstly, we are already defending your AVO matter and associated charge. I will be writing to the police with this new material that you have sent me in an effort to have the charge dropped. Of course you are able to write to the police multiple times, but I would suggest that you give me “all” of the evidence you wish to rely on before I send anything out.  \n
\nAs for the AVO against O’Neill, I think it should be done prior to the court hearing, and that is because if you are found guilty of the offence and an AVO is made against you in O’Neill’s favor, you will lose your right to make an AVO against him.  \n
Please let me know:  \n
1.    Whether you have any further evidence I can rely on to write to the police (in addition to the materials already received); and  \n2.    Whether you would like to start the AVO against proceedings against O’Neill asap? (keeping in mind costs).
\bThanks again Jonathan. I have placed your email as a VIP address and I will check my junk mail daily just in case.

- 4 Unless an Animal is an Approved Animal or an Assistance Animal, Owners must not keep, bring or permit an Animal, or allow any other persons to bring an Animal, on a Lot or the Common Property.
- 5 Owners wishing to keep an Animal may make an Application.
- 6 The Committee will consider the Application and, within 14 days of receipt of the Application, advise the Owner whether or not Approval is granted or whether there are any additional reasonable requirements to be satisfied. The Approval will not be unreasonably withheld.
- 7 Where an Owner chooses to keep fish and the fish tank affects the Common Property in any way, the fish tank must be approved by the Owners Corporation prior to installation and the Owner must produce sufficient information (including information relating to the drainage system, weight, capacity and size of the tank) to enable the Owners Corporation to make a reasonable assessment of the impact of the fish tank on the structural integrity of the Lot and the building. If, in the reasonable opinion of the Owners Corporation, an engineer's report on the structural integrity of the Lot and/or building is required, the Owner making the Application must bear the costs for the production of the report by an engineer nominated by the Owners Corporation.
- 8 The Committee may, in its sole discretion, refuse to provide an Approval for more than one Animal within a Lot.
- 9 If an Owner requires an Assistance Animal, they are required to provide the Owners Corporation with a letter from the relevant prescribed animal training organisation, or evidence that the Assistance Animal is accredited under NSW law.

\n_ _ _
PAGE 4

- - 10.1 Owners must keep their Approved Animal within the Lot;

- - 10.3 Owners must ensure that the Approved Animal does not cause any damage to a Lot or the Common Property;
- - 10.4 Owners must ensure that the Approved Animal does not create noise which continually disturbs other Owners' peaceful enjoyment of their property. In the event of continual disruption by an Animal, the Owners Corporation may request the Owner of the Animal to remove the Animal from the Lot and/or Common Property;
- - 10.5 In the event an Approved Animal causes harm (physical or otherwise) to any person on the Common Property or within a Lot, the Owners Corporation may direct the Owner of the Approved Animal to immediately remove the Approved Animal from the Lot and/or Common Property and the Owner must comply with that direction;
- - 10.6 Owners are responsible for the cleaning and the expense of cleaning of all areas within the Lot and/or Common Property, should such cleaning be required as a consequence of the Approved Animal's presence;
- - 10.7 Owners will not make a claim upon the Owners Corporation's insurance in respect of anything arising from the keeping of the Approved Animal;
- - 10.8 Owners must maintain the health and hygiene of the Approved Animal so as to prevent the spread of communicable diseases to other Approved Animals and people in the building;

- 11 The Owners Corporation may withdraw an Approval given under this by-law at any time, if the Approved Animal is or becomes vicious, noisy, offensive or a nuisance. By way of illustration, an Approved Animal may be determined by the Owners Corporation to be a nuisance if it regularly and loudly barks and/or yelps so as to interfere with any other Owner's quiet enjoyment of their Lot and/or use of Common Property.
- 12 Without affecting the Owners Corporation's rights under the Act, the Owners Corporation may issue a notice cautioning an Owner in respect of a breach of any of the provisions of this by-law.
- 13 A further breach under this by-law after a notice as referred to in clause 12 has been served on an Owner will entitle the Owners Corporation to require the immediate removal of the Animal from the building.
- 14 If the Owners Corporation withdraws an Approval, the Owner must remove the Approved Animal immediately from the Lot and keep the Approved Animal away from the Lot and Common Property.
- 15 Owners are responsible for all Costs.
- 16 Where the Owners Corporation has incurred Costs on behalf of an Owner, the Owners Corporation may recover those Costs from the Owner, including charging those Costs to the Owner's lot account as if they were a contribution under the Act, with all the same rights of recovery to apply.`
