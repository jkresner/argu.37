To whom it may concern,

Jonathon chronically suffers, medically speaking, on
the extreme end of the spectrum, to a traumatic
manifestation of Lyme disease presenting in approximately
6% of Chronic Lyme cases. Some symptoms Jonathon went to great
lengths in Australia failing in his efforts seeking help include:

- Abnormally fast heart beat
- High blood pressure
- Frequent headaches/migraines
- Deliberating join and muscle pain
- Neuropathology induced itching/tingling
- Unpleasant slow healing skin manifestations
- Difficulty with hot, humid, sweaty weather

Many patients I treat, presenting with his symptoms suffer
accompanying emotional and psychological trauma, often suicidal
in nature. However, hearing Jonathon's medical history and troubling
prior Healthcare experiences, I have come to appreciate Jonathon as exceptionally motivated, studious and commendably proactive on all
matters concerning his personal health and recovery.

In 2016 Jonathon visited numerous Australian specialists. Without
due attention to his character and concerns his doctors repeatedly
misinterpreted his words and misdiagnosed his condition. Absent any
satisfactory explanation, he investigated latest medical research papers,
correctly identified criteria and blood work to confirm his suspicions
and insisted referral for expensive, out of pocket private sector
tests. It is alarming Jonathon was told those results were negative,
recovering a copy (attached) of his report and see Borrelia burgdorferi unmistakably indicated positive. Borrelia is a very resistant spirochete
class bacteria and the causative agent of Lyme disease. The result
perfectly aligns with the honest and extreme account he clinical presented.
Jonathon's doctors failing to recognize, categorize and reject his opinion
ultimately left him untreated all this time.

Confused and unable to explain ongoing itching and pain post extenuating health-care handling, leaves patients with limited outlook on recovery.
Fatigue and skin ulcers can make presenting in public an unusually
uncomfortable event. The requirement and spending of higher than normal
time leads to hyper-vigilance attention on environment variables
with even the slightest possible impact on well being. Previously
unprecedented and exceptional levels of priority are placed on
cleanliness, including dust, mold and pest free in effort to rule out
as mysteriously responsible possible underlying cause. Neuropathy induced
formication and associated imagery of ticks makes patients particularly sensitive about the presence of insects. In general,
stresses that can be removed for a patient environment should. Additional
strain on the immune system can exacerbate symptoms and heighten
existing anxiety with ongoing discomfort.

Jonathon mentioned he lost control over and access to use his home as
refuge from his illness almost all of 2017. I do not know the details.
However, I do not lightly warn, the serious state and mishandling of
his health leave most patients with permanently physical and psychological ramification. We have a long road with treatment for him ahead. Commonly
in his condition, Lyme disease take as long to heal as was left untreated.
At this later than reasonable stage, it would at great detriment
compromising his recovery with unnecessary stress, or creating
additional hurdles for him to attend our clinic in San Francisco and
finally receive appropriate care.
