###### by author JK &copy; 2019

Welcome. I'm *JK*, an Aussie born Silicon Valley tech entrepreneur, CEO, software maker and owner at 37 Paul St. Managing a diligent Strata Scheme is incredibly hard. Doing a good job and keeping people happy is even harder. I believe achieving **Strata living Harmony** requires all owners to embrace mutual respect, ongoing collaborative effort and complete transparency.

Like other meaningful challenges I come across, I spent weeks researching technology to help my neighbors more efficiently communicate and compliantly govern our building under **Strata Scheme Management Act**  guidelines. I pieced together **Strata Committee** news and email infrastructure, secure Strata Record document storage, wikis for By-laws and Common Property guides like "Garbage protocols", a forum for maintenance and legislative discussion, a shared calendar to post and track noisey renovation/construction schedules and e-voting tools to make it easier than ever for owners AND even tenants to **"get involved"**.

Sadly we don't all get along, resulting in a multi-year **Concrete Cancer** denial dispute. Frustrations put aside, I optimistically purchased 37paulst.com on my own dime, neatly deployed my **Owners Corp infrastructure** goody bag, all accessible from one website using any browser and offered to hand over all my efforts (free!).

Failed waterproofing, rusted rebar and concrete spalling eventually derailed my whole life. In 2017 I invested more time into creative non-confrontational **Strata dispute resolution** attempts than it took me to launch and raise $2M in venture funding for my most recent and heavily suffering tech Startup. In 2018 I deep-dived full-time into **Strata caselaw** research and meeting **Strata lawyers** only to find **NSW Strata litigation** landscape in period of uncertainty and flux. Luckily entrepreneurs are used to finding opportunity where others see only anarchy and the greatest insights and innovation often incubate during the most painful personal experiences.

I was learning so much along the way, without a friendly or fair outlet to share, that is, until deciding to channel my creativity and thoughts cohesively here.

Strata participation is fundamentally getting to know and manage co-owned property with others. A little background shines a lot of context on the depth of  circumstances influencing chosen courses of action, growing frustration and ultimately deciding to publishing an e-book on my Strata living experience.

Folks I've just met, rarely conceive how much consideration sits behind things I say and do. I've been chosen as scapegoat as of late, misrepresented without fair audience to hear my side of the story and listen to my perspective and concern.

## Walking the Entrepreneur's Tightrope

[![AirPair YCombinator](/img/jk-afr-airpair-yc-crop.jpg)](#) In 2014 I was featured in the Australian Financial Review. My 3rd company got accepted into *YCombinator*, The World's most prestigious *Tech Startup Accelerator* that had produced household names like Dropbox and AirBnB. At the program finale, in a room of 500 investors, I pitched "AirPair" *barefoot*... and 48 hours later, just like that we had **$2M**(AUD) venture funding in the bank.

Finding a way onto the Silicon Valley roller coaster requires entrepreneurs to constantly consider unconventional new approaches to everyday life, which conservative thinking (by definition) seem a bit crazy, until eventually becoming widely accepted innovation. Decades in that mentality has lead me through experiences learning cross-discipline skills in all aspects of running a company from software engineering to marketing, customer experience, product design, fund raising, business strategy, financial modeling, book keeping/auditing and financial reporting.

Having the metal to convince people to embrace new ideas essentially boils down to having a hyper-motivated, higher than normal passionate, opinionated, confident and often bullish outlook. When people ask me "What's it like living in San Francisco?"  I say, the biggest difference is the time of day people entertain new and strange ideas. It's an encouraging environment for personalities like me. There's a fine line between exercising those qualities and being misinterpreted as overly persistent, too heated, unthoughtful and trying to be difficult. Looking back, I misjudged just how fine of a tightrope I got on, transitioning from San Fran back to Sydney and particularly Strata living at 37 Paul St with its diverse constitution age groups, cultural differences and competing financial interests. Poorly defined channels and communication expectations made me often feel I had fallen to a cold, dark and isolated place.

## Bringing work back home in Sydney

Mid 2015 things were professionally moving really well. I found myself at 31, with a once in a lifetime privileged opportunity to combine personal wealth with a $1.3M mortgage and buy my late grandma's top floor 3-bedroom Bondi unit. I didn't get to this point being lazy, especially around managing personal and commercial finances. I had loads already on my plate. It was the biggest commitment ever. But it felt right. The apartment not only held decades of memories and sentimental value, in it you feel what makes it special and worthy of paying for a higher *Unit Entitlement* than all owners on our Strata Plan.

Until issues at 37 Paul St, I could go home leaving arguments at work. When not CEO, I default to avoiding confrontation. Unfortunately Strata common property issues handled badly spill into people's homes causing personal problems hard to ignore.

AirPair was connecting companies around the globe on-demand 24/7 to thousands of remote software consultants of all nationality. I work at home over variably unconventional hours. Ongoing unscheduled construction caused immediate problems.

Early 2016 a big project to repairs everyone's balconies and repaint the building kicked off. Scheduled 22 weeks, it was managed so poorly that it took 2 years along with devastating incapacitation on my ability to work. I'd was without access  6 months hiding on the other side of the pacific ocean bleeding lost income before commitment to fighting Soul crushing  management of my Strata scheme.

## Managing late-diagnosed Lyme disease

In 2016 a top Australian Neurologists diagnosed my frequent migraines, headaches and shaky hands from "Tension mialgia", a muscular skeletal condition causing all my muscles to constantly contract front the back of my head right through to fingers and toes. He noted it didn't explain carpel tunnel and muscular pain, high blood pressure and various skin symptoms I was experiencing. I saw all different specialists, without success and was quite confused, actively researching possibilities and hyper-sensitive over variables that could effect a person's health. It wasn't until April 2018 I attended a medical conference for my specific symptoms in Austin, TX where I met specialists who went through my history and found Lyme positive lab results. Manging chronic Lyme symptoms with water constantly leaking into my apartment, frequent pests/insect coming from untreated common properly and not having a habitable home with place to shower for 12 months added huge additional emotional strain to an already difficult unanticipated circumstances.

Until my Strata Concrete Cancer saga ends so I can get on with my renovation, the apartment is a cold empty concrete shell. I can't enjoy home activities in this particularly difficult period of my life, that have always helped take my mind off emotional and physical stress.

##### Entrenched extortion

All problems stem from parties believing they have greater entitled than others. Greater say on how money is spent (in our case OC funds abused for personal use). Greater access to Records.

***"Good faith"*** is mentioned a few times in the Strata Scheme Management Act. Particularly committee members should be away that they should be acting in their own interests at Annual/Extraordinary General Meetings, but when it comes to officer duties and Committee votes, they are expected to conduct themselves with the Owners Corporation interests before their own.

Combined a blatantly unscrupulous Strata Agent exercises OC authority with their own priorities first, landing in a Strata Committee <> Strata Agent *coalition hell* can make everything you need from Strata just about impossible. They'll charge unreasonable stupid fees wherever you don't look, block your ability to govern and get shit done and take the shortest route, carefree of how efficiently OC money is spent. Like O'Neill, they don't care if your roof has not blown off, when not in the Committee club.

##### Transparency turmoil

There hasn't been a properly called Committee Meeting or minutes produced other than shoddy post AGM assigning offices since 2013.

When people know things aren't fair, everything happens behind closed doors, making not only contributions but in extremes like our scheme participation and even every curiosity impossible,

##### Dysfunctional communications and knowledge exchange

Once getting information is restricted, people don't know how to control, help solve or even influence problems.

<!-- ![](/jk/lot36/2017-04-14-IMG_5422.JPG) -->

##### Strata legislation and by-law ignorance

In the worst situations, even the people running things have no clue. Eventually things hit the fan.

##### Capital planning and levy estimation
<!-- ![](/jk/lot36/2017-01-23-IMG_2672.JPG) -->
When know one knows the act, big things like not having
a 10 year Capital Works Plan for more than a decade, disaster
has is already at the front door, maybe even in your floor.

##### Financial disarray

Special levy after special levy. We took out $1M that has to be paid off, but
common property is still in disrepair everywhere.

It's been a difficult transitional time. Owners bought it 40 years ago and the old ones don't want to spend, but the new want nice new things, just like the oldies did when the moved in.

##### Unmanageable disrepair & maintenance
<!-- ![](/jk/lot36/2016-09-06-IMG_4094.JPG) -->
Our remedial balcony repairs were scheduled 22 weeks at $700k. After two years
it's impossible to figure out the bottom line though probably close to $1.4

Not staying on top of maintenance, particularly problems like a failed rooftop water membrane and spreading concrete cancer get more expensive, disruptive and possibly become legal liability.

##### Dereliction of duty

Burnout
<!-- === Difference in expectations -->
<!--  with  no one seemed to know anything about. The Strata Committee handled my concerns really poorly. The Secretary basically told me it was too much work tracking things happening in the building. Later I learned we had a Special By-law crafted charging the Secretary to manage a schedule of noisy works and the Committee had looked at or didn't care about our By-laws.

# Easy reading, hybrid print-web publishing

## Background

*section in progress*

## Challenges

No one wants to hear my story. Even I don't enjoy hearing my story. **Strata dispute suck** period.

The *"Domain"* of a given technology is the real world context it is designed to be for. In my case, a very un-fun experience of handing strata schemes. It's been awful to think though and constantly relive the experiences to collect and organize them in a presentable manner. It would be completely impossible to hand craft by word processor. Next I tried a spreadsheet-like multimedia tool and gmail labels. I'd
gone though 200 emails 3 times but I still couldn't deal with the information overload.

The problems:
- I didn't now how to organize things
- What was important and what not (obsessive or honest?)
- If I missed context I might not be telling the proper story (police example)


## Requirements

### Easy consumption of complicated content

Present the info as clear and consumable as possible

- To lawyers (on the clock)
- To neighbors (printed my have higher chance of consumption)
- In court or submitted application

>> eBook format

### Full facts

During this experience I thought so much about how different people experience the same serials events due to:

- Preconceptions
- Bias (intentional & unconscious)
- Their personal technology setup
- Party to all or subset of interactions

## Knowing what I know now

Friends have asked, why not just walk away, sell it?

### Before buying

Perhaps. The reality is nothing is worth the trouble I've been though and I'd rather have not been inspired to write all these things down.

### Once committed

Beyond having years as seasoned CEO staying patient & persistent and headstrong in competitive high stake financial situations, the apartment has significant sentimental value to me and my father. I love living in it, it's worth fighting for. Overall if a wizard could have told me what's in store, I would have passed up moving in. Of course, there was no telling on the way.

Here are things I would have tried to explain to myself or anyone else wonder how to handle life disturbing Strata circumstances.

One of the Strata resolution angles I tried was to speak at an official committee meeting on liability to basically get them to see if wasn't good for any party
to leave my apartment the way it was or draw the delay further.

A fundamental problem with our Scheme is that the committee doesn't properly meet
or provide notice or minutes on affairs that need to be taken care of. So in the
end they spent +$1M on remedial works without any accessible paper-trail.


## Strata compliance is a *really* big feat

Our Strata Agent wouldn't have a clue and has allowed our Scheme to go off the deep end. In the end, its the Owners Corporation who has to pay for things.

## Liability

### Enter SSMA 2015 s106(5)

https://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/#/view/act/2015/50/part6/div1/sec106

A new provision under an otherwise familiar section gives owners the ability to recover personal costs arising from breach of duty.

> > ##### **106**   Duty of owners corporation to maintain and repair property
1. > An owners corporation for a strata scheme must properly maintain and keep in a state of good and serviceable repair the common property and any personal property vested in the owners corporation.
2. > An owners corporation must renew or replace any fixtures or fittings comprised in the common property and any personal property vested in the owners corporation.
3. > This section does not apply to a particular item of property if the owners corporation determines by special resolution that:
  - it is inappropriate to maintain, renew, replace or repair the property, and
  - its decision will not affect the safety of any building, structure or common property in the strata scheme or detract from the appearance of any property in the strata scheme.
4. > If an owners corporation has taken action against an owner or other person in respect of damage to the common property, it may defer compliance with subsection (1) or (2) in relation to the damage to the property until the completion of the action if the failure to comply will not affect the safety of any building, structure or common property in the strata scheme.
5. > *** An owner of a lot in a strata scheme may recover from the owners corporation, as damages for breach of statutory duty, any reasonably foreseeable loss suffered by the owner as a result of a contravention of this section by the owners corporation. ***
6. > An owner may not bring an action under this section for breach of a statutory duty more than 2 years after the owner first becomes aware of the loss.
7. > This section is subject to the provisions of any common property memorandum adopted by the by-laws for the strata scheme under this Division, any common property rights by-law or any by-law made under section 108.
8. > This section does not affect any duty or right of the owners corporation under any other law.

## What is concrete cancer?

Concrete Cancer (CC) develops when steel bars inside concrete corrode and expand up to 8-10 times causing rusted bars to protrude and concrete to swell, crack and break apart (“spalling”). Causes present in the case of Lot 36 include:


[**![Rusted bars](/jk/cc/cracking_door_sofit.jpg)**](#) **Expansion** Cracking door soffit (under area) causing sliding doors to warm and not close properly.

** [![Rusted bars](/jk/cc/rusted_bars.jpg)](#) * *Treatment* Rusted bars excavated/exposed by jack hammer before treated (painted) with anti-corrosion chemicals. ***


## How do you know if you have concrete cancer?


## Should you care?

### Are you renovating?

Severe bar expansion causes adjacent layers, including floor leveling, waterproofing, paint and tiles to crack, bubble and malfunction. In turn, fixtures, fittings and vested property is ruined from resultant moisture and mould.

### Is personal property exposed?


## What causes concrete cancer?


Atmospheric       => Salty ocean air
Electrochemical     => Wet Magnesite
Ingress of moisture     => Waterproofing failures
Leaking windows     => Damaged balcony sliding doors
Lack of cover       => Top level apartments (u36,u35,u37)
Poor quality concrete     => Thin slabs
Poor design       => No waterproof membranes

Quite an interesting, but very time consuming en-devour. The most annoying realization is that especially in what currently feels like a transition period major verdicts don't feel very final and solid. Most cases seem to be going back and forth.

## Background

## Challenges

- Overwhelming information volume
- Don't have any legal application examples to follow
- Time consuming (in my case impossible) to bring it together

## Requirements

1 Take raw information

2 Efficient combining into "issues"

- Actors (individuals & legal entities)
- Sources (artifacts of evidence)
- Clauses (legislative, statue and contractual applicable)
- Explanation (legal arguments)
- Implications (financial loss, developed assumptions, emotions etc.)

3 To quickly define "incidents"

- Series of chronological issues

4 Output incident(s) as legal application

- Summary (raw figures)
- Annex (evidence table/index separate)
- In-line (evidence intertwined)
