\nAlso I've spoken to a couple of others who are interested in renos and wondering about if the comittee would be happy for me to get quotes on not only my apartment to see if others would be interested in such works that would make the building more modern, enjoyable and valuable.
\nHere's some details, please let me know if we can chat.
\nMin Scope
- · Remove kitchen walls (demo by MDP)
- · Remove all tiling in both bathrooms and laundry and confirm of cause of leaks and moisture (demo by MDP)
- · Remove entrance and hallway tiles (MDP)
- · Confirm allowed weight for 4-6 seated spa on balcony
\nExtra scope
- · Remove entrance archway, joinery and backing (making living room and entrance open).
- · Remove cupboards and backing walls in master bedroom (to redesign into commonly accessible bathroom)
- · Assess extending north east facing window from floor to ceiling.
- · Assess extending plumbing and electricity from kitchen to outdoors
- · Assess possibility of running Gas from main into the apartment.
- · Assess possibility of reducing footprint of structural beams with alternate concrete/ materials` },

\nSince O'Neil have faulted on more than one occasion to supply building information and I've now spoken to at least 4 other owners with the same experience and complaints, I suggest a two prong strategy.
\n- 1) We replace O'Neil in the coming weeks with a more hands, organised on and helpful agent.
\n- 2) We setup a secure repository of historical records of meetings/minutes, reports and budgets for unit holders.
\nUltimately such changes would reduce comittee workload and friction.
\nI am going to setup (2) next week, but won't make it accessible until comittee approved.
\nShould the comittee not wish to proceed with either (1) or (2), I will call for an Extraordinary Meeting of which I have enough other interested unit holders already confirmed.
\nIf the comittee does wish to stay in its exact current make up, I suggest you make me a Information Technology adviser so that I may help in an offical capacity with smoothing out committee operations and administration.

\nA majority of the committee have requested an extraordinary general meeting be called.
\nWe are happy with 3 May. Would you be able to book John for that date? (if he's not still available we'll take 2 or 4).
\nThe main reason for the commitee's request is to deal with the renovation requests of units 2 and 36, and (if they are ready) by-laws for renovations in future (although I note Jonathon Kresner has suggested some other items he would like to add to the agenda).
\nI'll send you some things for the papers (which I assume have to go out 2 weeks before) some time next week.

'15b5116187f6cf41': { f: `rick_ogh`, md: `(1) Sliding doors
\nThanks for sending through your quote. It covers some but not all of the things required.
\nHaving spoken to another contractor, and looked at your quote and the other contractor's, the committee's preference now is for MDP to manage the whole door installation process (that way they can coordinate the removal of the old door, the installation of temporary weather protection, and the installation of the new door).
\nThe committee is OK with your preference for two sliding panels and one fixed in your living room if that is still what you want - provided you pay the difference in price between the that and two fixed and one sliding door (we can tell MDP to liaise with you about this).
\nThe committee wants the doors to match the others in the building (the horizon wideline model would be OK, but the paragon model referred to in the attached quote has a wider frame which doesn't match). I think in one of your messages you suggested you wanted a single panel for the window (rather than multiple panels which you have at the moment.
\n(2) Your renovations and the EGM
\nAs for the general meeting - I have Bill Moisidis' engineer's report but it would be useful to have a description of the renovations you want approval for (e.g. is it just approval for removal of the walls referred to in the report of Bill M dated XXXXX; is it removal and replacement of kitchen tiles, benchtops etc). If you are not sure at this stage what you want other than the demolition work, that's fine - we can just deal with that for the time being. If you want approval for the spa, could you include details of the spa (perhaps you can send us what you sent Bill). I can then send O'Neills some material to go in the papers for the EGM before I go on holidays next Wednesday.

'15b5717822c74f35': { f: `JK`, md: `With regard to (1), I'm not fused about the make of door and am content to have it as similar to everyone else as possible. I appreciate the committe being ok with 2 sliding panels out of the living room and will liaise with Peter and happily cover costs. The only thing I will mention is that the wideline engineer told me horizon was not as suitable for high wind/ salt / moisture compared with Paragon. Ultimately I'm ok with any decision by the comittee, but maybe worth confirming with Bill?
\nI have a clearer idea of (2) please tell me if this is sufficient information or I can give additional. The SPA is not really renovation. Most contention around the topic would be with regard to noise. I have never and would not in the future be a noisey tenant and would abide by not making noise late at night. If the operation of the spa is considered noisey by Vlad who would be the only one probable to here anything, I would make sure it is always switched off at night.

\n0) non structural single brick wall removal
\nThe following non-load bearing walls will be and are depicted as removed above.
- · kitchen walls
- · master bed ensuite wall / door frame
- · entry arch and wall (up to structural column)
\n1) flooring & blinds
\nAll areas containing magnesite will have been stripped and require reflooring per OC responsibility to repair anything within a lot damaged to undergo common property repairs. This includes blinds, new screed (e.g. Sand cement levelling) and carpet for STUDY, EAST BEDROOM, LIVING ROOM and MASTER BEDROOM.
\n** If the comittee indicate their intent to approve my rennovation including balcony SPA and therefore allow me to begin ordering materials with common 4-8 week lead time, I will pay for all blinds and flooring myself (guessing absolute minimum $10k-$15k).
\n** Additionally if I can begin my reno this week, avoiding further uninhabitable lot relocation expenses, I will not seek to reclaim such losses for any length of time from the OC. Alternatively, with 6 week wait time and already having protruding rusted bars and concrete dust in every room for a month we are looking at least $10k (on an assumption of $1k p.w. for a total of 10 weeks)
on a side note, commencing renovations immediately has the benefit to inconvinence the building no additional length of time since MDP are already making noise both outside and within my apartment.
\n2) Entry / LDY
\nTitles will be removed and refloored. Materials depended on committee decision on taking my offer to pay for flooring and commence works sooner.
\n3) Bathroom
-All plumbing service outlets will remain as is
- · change of cistern
- · new shower and bath taps
- · small adjustments to power outlets
- · new vanity and washing taps
- · removal of fixed bath and replacement with freesltanding bath
- · complete removal of tiles
- · new water-proof membrane
- · retiling of floor and walls
- · review / fix ventilation
\n4) Master Bedroom / open plan ensuite
- · New fixed cupboards (design not finalised)
- · Glass panel feature
- · New shower mount position, shower heads and taps
- · New vanity and washing taps
- · Toilet moved approx 50cm towards/into corner
- · new water-proof membrane
- · retiling of floor and walls
\n5) Kitchen
\n* For fire safety compliance a structural change consisting of a vent from ceiling to building rooftop is requested as well as OC replacing kitchen window to remove non-functioning exhaust fan system.
- · Removal of vinyl and original cork floor and replaced with tiles
- · Complete removal and replacement of cabinets
- · New inbuilt oven
- · New inbuilt cooktop
- · New inbuilt fridge
- · Ceiling exhaust system
- · New bench tops
- · Preparation area / Bar table feature around central column
\n6) Other
- · misc electrical outlet changes
- · install air-conditioning mounted on the building rooftop`

\nDear All So this is an awning window on top of the doors – if the door is made 2100 high, then there will be about 200mmm of frame (top and bottom of the awning) leaving 100mmm of glass in the awning window… In my opinion, the amount of glass in the top operable window is quite minimal (see attached drawing) -only 100mm of glass - and the additional elevation height of the frame ends up being 200mm… Is this what the Owners want? ?? as the system for the building (when the time comes to replace the doors)?? Please also note that the 2100 door height is quite minimal – especially considering when we have the option of a 2400mm high door. In my opinion, a full height door provides the simplest way forward (in terms of door design and waterproofness) as well as not having additional operable windows for maintenance and corrosion of winders etc Peter requires a direction on this so he can proceed to ordering – please advise.

\nTried to call you and left message. Spoke to AWS regarding a sliding window highlight. The only thing we can do is an awning style window that you push out manually. Attached is the detail that AWS provided me. Just be aware that the doors with the highlights will look slightly different that the door without as we need to use different sections to incorporate the awning windows. We can not incorporate sliding or even louvres due to the height left over with the door at 2100 If they choose to go with this options I will get back to you with a price.

\n[Window safety devices in strata: install by 13 March](http://www.fairtrading.nsw.gov.au/ftw/Tenants_and_home_owners/Strata_schemes/Window_and_balcony_safety/Window_safety_device_requirements.page?%22)
\nDo you live in, own or manage a townhouse or unit block? To prevent children falling from windows, strata schemes must have window safety devices installed on all applicable windows by 13 March 2018. This applies to openable windows where the internal floor is more than 2m above the surface outside and within a child's reach (less than 1.7m above the inside floor).
\nThe devices must:
- · enable the maximum opening to be less than 12.5cm (a device that allows the window to be fully opened, fully closed and limited to less than 12.5cm is compliant), and
- · be able to withstand a force of 250 newtons (which is equal to 25 kilograms of force).
\nComplying safety devices include devices attached to a window frame or robust bars (as long as the opening can be limited to less than 12.5cm and can withstand a force of 250 newtons). Complying devices must also be installed on applicable windows in all common access areas, such as stair landings.
\nIf window safety devices are not installed by 13 March 2018, owners corporations may face fines. Owners corporations are not required to monitor or enforce the use of window safety devices but must ensure they are installed by the 13 March deadline.
\nResidents with safety devices installed can still fully open their windows if they wish to do so, but it is strongly recommended that devices be engaged whenever children are present, to prevent falls.
\n[Is the cladding on your apartment building fire safe?](http://www.fairtrading.nsw.gov.au/ftw/Tenants_and_home_owners/Fire_safety_and_external_wall_cladding.page)
\nThe Fire Safety and External Wall Cladding Taskforce launched a campaign this month, aimed at residents and tenants of multi-storey apartment buildings in NSW.
\nOwners can ensure their building is safe, by:
- · finding out if their building has aluminium cladding
- · checking whether their building has a current and up-to-date fire safety statement
- · ensuring a fire safety professional has inspected any cladding, and
- · taking immediate action to make any recommended changes.
\nTenants should contact their managing agent or landlord to check if the above steps have been taken.
\n[A reminder about gifts and benefits](http://www.fairtrading.nsw.gov.au/ftw/Property_agents_and_managers/Rules_of_conduct/Disclosure_requirements.page#Strata_managing_agents_must_not_receive_gifts_or_other_benefits)
\nStrata managing agents must not request or accept a gift or other benefit for themselves or another person. There are a few exceptions. An agent may accept:
- · standard remuneration paid by an owners corporation
- · a monetary commission, if the provision is within the terms of the managing agency agreement, or has been otherwise approved by the owners corporation
- · a training service provided to, or paid for, a strata managing agent, if it was related to strata      management functions and the provision is within the terms of the managing agency agreement, or has been otherwise approved by the owners corporation
- · a gift or other benefit that is not over the amount of $60.00
- · gifts or other benefits provided to the agent by their employer.
\nThe maximum amount of $60 allows agents to receive reasonable refreshments when attending meetings for example, and small gifts by the owners corporation in appreciation of services provided by the agent.
\n[Strata Collective Sale Advocacy Service](http://www.fairtrading.nsw.gov.au/ftw/Tenants_and_home_owners/Strata_schemes/Collective_sale_and_renewal.page?)
\nIf your strata scheme decides to consider a collective sale and renewal process, there are free legal advice services to assist lot owners from vulnerable groups, such as those on the aged or disability pension.
\nEligible owners will be able to seek advice on the proposed sale and renewal.`

  "Unit 36 37 Paul St letter to BC.pdf": `###### 19 March 2018
** To: The Strata Committee SP13385- Kepplegate**  \n**Re: Unit 36/37 Paul Street, Bondi Junction**
\nMy name is Laurie Kresner, father of Jonathon.
\nAt the outset, I apologise for Jonathon’s language, I regret it is unbecoming and outside the norm and unnecessary to communicate his frustrations.
\n(Your emails to my brother on Friday have been forwarded to me, to which I now respond).
\nJohn O’Neill states that he intends making an official report to the Police about his perceived threat by Jonathon on the urging by Mary Atkinson and another unnamed single lady.  (In what way did he threaten this unnamed single lady?)
\nI’m surprised Mary Atkinson did not contact me direct, as I met and chatted about my mother with her, a resident in the building for 30 years, and forwarded a letter to her (via Strata Agent) complaining the lack of action with the bathroom leak in Jonathon’s ensuite several months ago.
\nIn her email of 16th March 2018 she refers to the “unfortunate time with his unit and the contractors etc..”
\nWhilst Mary Atkinson was Chairman of the Body Corporate she oversaw the disastrous building contract that has left the Body Corporate defunct of Capital Works funds.  (To which my family via my mother contributed substantially to for over 30 years).
\nAbout 12 months ago, Jonathon, for reasons of his own, decided to renovate his unit to a standard he envisaged.  He proceeded to uncover the spalling floor concrete which ultimately revealed concrete cancer over parts of his unit.  He placed the spoil in the builder’s rubbish bin to which he (and all the other unit holders were paying for under the builder’s contract to remove external spalling concrete).  If one checks the building unit entitlement, our family (and later Jonathon) pays far in excess of all other unit holders year in, year out.  He was entitled (as per other unit owners) to use the bin for this purpose (spall removal).
\nFor some unknown reason, Mary Atkinson and committee took offence and whilst Jonathon was overseas re-dumped the spall rubbish back into Jonathon’s bedroom.  Frankly it must have cost the unit holders far more money to double handle his rubbish by this action.
\nTo me it seems that the committee was looking for a scapegoat, with the building cost running out of control, Jonathon was an easy target and logical deviation.  Therefore, it seems to me it was a weak childlike decision to divert attention to a minor issue away from the real issue of incompetent committee management.
\nHistory records that the concrete cancer cracked the slab in the front bedroom which caused the front door to buckle and unable to be closed.
\nWeek after week whilst Jonathon was overseas, the builders had access to Jonathon’s unit but nothing happened.  I personally enquired from the builder’s foreman about progress.
\nMary Atkinson and the committee unduly procrastinated with giving the order to fix the floor (knowing full well they were legally bound to do so) and the order was not given to the builder to proceed somewhere between 9 – 12 months after.  This completely frustrated Jonathon in his ability to commence his own building works.
\nThe new window did not go into place for at least 9 months to make his unit watertight.
\nThis scenario with Jonathon is getting out of hand with players getting personally involved. (It may be wise to take both Elizabeth Bateman /Mary Atkinson out of the loop to get an unbiased picture).
\nThe present Body Corporate has an obligation to show fairness to Jonathon (and his frustrations) by showing some of the history of the 12 months or so and including this letter to the investigating Police, if the letter or official report has been sent by John O’Neill.  Please confirm that this has been done and to which Police Station and Officer handling it?
\nP.S. I did attend a different Body Corporate meeting, where significant capital works are required, not far away from Kepplegate, where the same Project Engineer and Strata Manager are involved and I was assured by the Project Engineer that the works carried out by the builder were right on both time and budget. Perhaps it is time to consider for the new Body Corporate to terminate the services of the Strata Manager and Project Engineer.  There are many Strata Managers and most Strata Body Corporates tender the service of the Strata Manager periodically.
\nP.P.S I also point out that I had previously sent a letter to the Strata Manager that water was penetrating from Jonathon’s ensuite and flowing under his wardrobe.  Jonathon did not wish me to pursue this further as he wanted to be able to deal with the Body Corporate on his own. However, a reply came back from the Strata Agent that water was soaking from the old tiles. – Nonsense!
\nBefore a Tiler tiles a bathroom, a Waterproofer comes in and lays a membrane to give a complete seal.  Apparently, the Strata Manager sent in a Plumber to remove the bottom row of tiles and replace them.  Why? No logic!   All it did was to break the waterproof seal and make things worse.
\nSincerely,  \nLaurie Kresner`

\nYou are now, for some inexplicable reason, denying access to the unit in order for work to completed on the balcony. Certainly application for an Order can be made, however I need to remind you of S.122 of The Strata Schemes Management Act 2015 - Power of owners corporation to enter property in order to carry out work:
\n- (1) *An [owners corporation](http://www8.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ssma2015242/s4.html#owners_corporation) for a [strata scheme](http://www8.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ssma2015242/s4.html#strata_scheme) may, by its agents, employees or contractors, enter on any part of the [parcel](http://www8.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ssma2015242/s4.html#parcel) of the scheme for the purpose of carrying out the following work:*  \n  - (a) *work required or authorised to be carried out by the [owners corporation](http://www8.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ssma2015242/s4.html#owners_corporation] in accordance with this Act (including work relating to window safety devices and rectification work carried out under Part 11),  *\n  - (b) *work required to be carried out by the [owners corporation](http://www8.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ssma2015242/s4.html#owners_corporation) by a notice given to it by a [public authority](http://www8.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ssma2015242/s4.html#public_authority),*  \n  - (c) *work required or authorised to be carried out by the [owners corporation](http://www8.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ssma2015242/s4.html#owners_corporation) by an order under this Act.*  \n- (5) *A person must not obstruct or hinder an [owners corporation](http://www8.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ssma2015242/s4.html#owners_corporation) in the [exercise](http://www8.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ssma2015242/s4.html#exercise) of its [functions](http://www8.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ssma2015242/s4.html#function) under this section. Maximum penalty: 5 penalty units.*
\nIn this instance S122(4) does not necessarily apply. You are again delaying the works required to complete the spalling rectification and thus increasing the costs associated with these works.

\nRight this moment, the pipes are dry. They were wet this week up until now.
\nInside the garage, extensive spalling damage previously patched up at the back of the garage, presumably storm water / sewer draining from the common stack on the south side of the building. Pipes maybe leaked for a long time by the look of the mineral buildup. Probably the pipe joins all need to be replaced or repatched. The dirt/rust is common where the pipes meet through the garage.
\n![IMG_7810.jpg](__IMG_7810.jpg__inln.jpg)
\nThe water starts in appearance as condensation, the more it rains the heavier it gets util it's big frequent drops all the way down the pipe. Only the brown pipe is wet, the bigger gray one seems fine and does not show on thermal imaging. The problem is consistent with the pipe leading into 33 on the other side of the basement. It has been dripping so much that the floor is stained green in the shape of the pipe.

\nI've had to throw out a lot of my possessions and clothing from mould / rust damage. I hear the basement has smelled bad for years.
\nOn the outside / front of the garage is noticeable concrete damage / cracking which looks like it was also patched up. The thermal imagine hints there could be a leak in the pipe under the slab. The water builds in a circle around the base of the pipe as it comes up out of the concrete.

\nI have been experiencing ongoing nuisance, obstructing usage/enjoyment of my lot (SSMA2015 s153) since I moved in. While half my lot remained unusable/rentable due to a shower/waterproofing leak, records indicate yours was fixed using OC funds. I've been unable to enjoy my lot in entirety since Feb 2017 and as it currently stands:
\nLess than 1/10th of my lot usable in only a very temporary capacity

- · I cannot sanitize myself
- · I cannot prepare/sit to eat meals
- · I cannot sit to rest (on a couch)
- · I cannot securely store personal property without it being damaged

\nTomorrow I will submit tribunal application. The application will be permanently entered into the Strata records. All s109 certificates will have to list the building entangled in legalities. We will have to host one or more EGMs to scrutinize all financials and committee conduct from at least 2015-2017. It's going to be a huge time suck and unpleasant for everyone.

\nTribunal is where I get orders for the Owners Corp to fix the remaining items they ignored. My unit, the hallways, the rooftop etc. I will also seek around $500k and rising monthly damages for losses rent and lost professional income.

\n### From: Peter Damiano Sent: Wed, 20 December 2017 1:32 PM To: Jonathon Kresner Bill Moisidis Subject: RE: One more round in #36
\nI have attempted to answer most of your questions in <ins>**red**</ins> below. I will leave any other comments to Bill Moisidis.
\n### From: Jonathon Kresner Sent: Wednesday, 20 December 2017 1:08 PM To: Bill Moisidis Peter Damiano Subject: One more round in #36
\nI'm not wantIng to be painful. I'm just wanting you to come into my apartment one last time, and no more than that. I want to lay tiles and get on with my life. I'm allergic to carpet.  \n<ins>**Jonathon I just wish to complete my work and leave amicably. I would need access for one hour at a time but for few days. I can access your balcony from the roof but it would inconvenient with the material. We only would need access from your unit to the balcony. I hope you can assist.**</ins>
\nI have been homeless since February partly because of a terrible committee, partly because Belmont keeps making bad scope calls and not diligently checking completed work.
\n1. Bill can I lay tiles on those cracks and how many years will Belmont be responsible for replacing cracked tiles? Many of the new patches of concrete are cracking. I will have another engineer to second your opinions. <ins>ZERO years. We have provided our advice on this (the cracks) already and await direction from strata</ins>
\n2. your answer to (1) is acceptable, I want the whole apartment ground back so we have the state of the slab fully documented and no more hidden cracks / rusted porturding bars. <ins>Awaiting approval on grinding the entire unit</ins>
\n3. I want one of you to pay that asshole $150 for work that you should have done and not created that situation for myself and Mr I enjoy damaging people's personal property. I also want to know that he no longer has building access and won't threaten me that he can enter whenever he pleases. That was creepy. <ins>**Not sure I am understanding? Who are you referring to?**</ins>
\n4. I want the sliding doors tuned properly and the living door room handle replaced with something more appropriate. <ins>**Please let me know when we can bring back the window manufacturer to tune your doors and advise on the handle.**</ins>
\n5. I want to understand what's going on the drainage on the balcony. It's been wet now for a while. How much do we need to rip out again for it to be done right? Do we have enough spare tiles still? Can I replace the below BCA regulation drain? Can I use this opportunity to provision for air conditioning and electricity like I've asked you guys +5 times now? <ins>**The downpipe was cracked way low into the slab. We have to get a plumber to repair this pipe and then we can close the opening up and retile . There will be no more work required on this balcony. Unfortunately this was an unforeseen event and we need to rectify as soon as possible. For any work such as Air Conditioning we can recommend to use our a/c contractor DELMAR air conditioning or any other local contractor.**</ins>
\n6. What were the decisions made about the hallway and rusted door jam. You don't have to answer specifically. Forward me all the correspondence for the year. <ins>We require approval to remove another 2 sqm of magnesite (already crumbled) so as to effect repair to the entire 4 sqm outside your door.</ins>`

'160681b51961c951': { f: 'JK', md: `1. Cash spent on plumbing + property damage from plumbing leaks:  \n2015 **$19K** Jan-Dec  \n2016FY **$12K** Aug-Jul  \n2016 **$15K** Jan-Dec  \n2017FY **$16.5K** Aug-Jul
\n2. **Eighteen (yes 18)** different line accounts across administration fund and capital works fund obfuscating the reality of plumbing leaks and water damage issues at 37 Paul St. Almost all of the expenses are day to day maintenance under the SSMA2015 they should be consistently accounted and paid for out of the administrative fund: * Insurance Claims Paid | Insurance Claims Excess | Maint Bldg Carpet | Maint Bldg Ceiling | Maint Bldg Electric | Maint Bldg Floors | Matin Bldg Hot Water | Service Maint Bldg Plumbing | Maint Bldg Pumps & Filters | Maint Bldg Roof & Guttering | Maint Bldg Sewers Drains | Matin Bldg Waterproofing | Sinking Carpet | Sinking Ceiling | Sinking Roof & Guttering | Sinking Plumbing & Drainage | Sinking Pumps & Filters | Sinking Special Levy Expense*
\n3. At least **22 of 37 lots affected** (yes **+60%**) since 2015 (that I know of) including: *u2 u3 u4 u6 u8 u9 u17 u18 u19 u21 u22 u24 u26 u28 u29 u31 u32 u33 u34 u35 u36 u37* + Plenty of undocumented stress...
\n4. Common property heavily damaged including bubbling wall paint, internal concrete cancer and trapped mould in common stacks + fixtures. Expect more $1M in slab and hallway repairs. $100k already u36 and abutting L8 hallway (with claims for personal losses).
\n5. Still OC and 2017 committee won't remove magnesite and repair CP diligently.
\n6. None of the showers or laundries were originally waterproofed. No one thought to protect the hallways / internal lot floors. O'Neill repetitively advised owners incorrectly that waterproofing was owner responsibility. But ALL showers are on boundary walls and the problems are consistent across almost all lots.
\n7. Committee owned lots (u19, u26, u31) get repaired / waterproofed. Non-committee owned lots with the same problems (u36) do not.
\n8. By-laws swindling on-going maintenance are in breach of SSMA2015 s139 will be repealed.
\n9. Insurance cost of about $30k goes mostly to softening plumbing. Could buy more suitable insurance products using these funds more helpful to the building.
\n10. SP13385 is covered for removal of building debris, yet committee still contravened duty to remove damaged magnesite / carpet and fix u36 door jam / CP water stack.
\n- - - - - -
\nThe attached reports are about 95% accurate since: I was blocked from inspecting the records by our agent and 2017 committee and spent hours doing it by hand when auto generated reports would take 5 minutes.
\nP.S. Thanks for appreciating my insights at AGM. I felt really great arriving from a 14 hour flight just to attend AGM and be ridiculed on insights from 20 hours of unpaid analysis. Very mature to right off my opinions on how the financial statement format could better serve the OC. It's obvious they are currently too shit quality for any of you (including the treasurer) to have had a proper look.
\nP.P.S. These reports and similar analysis on 2016/2017 transactions highlighting committee bad faith and doggy agent accountability will be available in supporting documentation with my Tribunal application. Im expecting the application posted in full on our noticeboard as per Strata Act legislation. `

I don’t have time to hold your hand and send screenshots, but if you do a quick internet search I believe it will outline that I in fact do know what I’m talking about.
\nI’m not going to reply to any more of these emails. This is my last on this topic.

'1602d0dddf74084b': { f: 'JK', md: `This email was for OC but also sent in good faith for you. I wanted to share nuance between conduct of officers/SC exposing:
\n- a) OC to liability (covered by us under Officer liability)  \n- b) Themselves to liability (void from Strata insurance coverage)
\nSaid in different way: Being on committee is hardly a privilege. It's a responsibility guaranteed to suck time and energy from your personal life that could potentially drain on your pocket too.
\nHopefully you've noted:
\n- · I'm very direct  \n- · Value transparency  \n- · Favor comparative advantage (over war)
\nIn that context for the last time, I afford you my position:
\n1. I thank you for time and energy invested in 2015/16/17. Special thanks Rick, Elena & Mary for years serving officially and unofficially under committee title dating back long before I arrived.
\n2. I know OC spent a lot of money on CP abuting my lot in 2017. In overcoming various accounting and disclosure hurdles, I have a very accurate picture. I imagine how those costs might make others feel.
\n3. I suffered losses of order in multiples of (2), due the to manner those works were conducted.
\n4. I am still accumulating losses from you circumventing of duty to maintain CP. Relevant water damage is minuted in 2014. My stock gap parable highlights all the issues. I don't even need to get into my ensuite leak to establish my rusted door jam, L8 hallway + common stack were damaged by OC fault. However, even if fault wasn't crystal clear - the law says to fix it.
\n5. I advocate addressing broader issues inhibiting compliant and cost effective Scheme management. First with you direct, then up a notch to committee meeting (below email), up again to EGM/AGM (where my items consistently habit last place/end of night attention). I will continue to escalate until all exercise, omissions and decision not to exercise functions which circumvents duty and law are exposed by jackhammer and treated the expensive way, so a new floor can be laid.
\n6. With all my grief until this point, I still want to embark on a path recovering my losses where all my neighbors can benefit instead of loose.
\n7. My final and undesired recourse is court, where I will do everything in my power to protect the rest of the OC. That means, I am vested in this path by motivations beyond financial verdict. Submitting my analysis and position on the record and permanently to the Strata Roll not only on my affairs, but the the way SP13385 affairs are managed will benefit (5) and catalyze proper fiduciary due diligence attemptedly absolved by Kelly Partner's yearly opening statements.
\nPlease consider the corner you have put me in and all the firepower you left me under the chair. Without OC consent, SC took legal action against MDP, which I've paid for in more ways than one throughout 2017. You will have to call a general meeting to attain consent this time round. I'll be there advocated in great detail why OC should deny any support including the obvious opportunity to seek costs from you vs be liable to me.
\nAvoiding war is only possible when parties talk. Talking enables understanding and collaboration towards mutual benefit. Sadly, my historical catalogue of evidence (example screenshot of 1/100 attached) shows SC/Secretary receives correspondence and fails to exercise duty to answer by decision not to.

\nIf you are open to try a change of pace and entertain a completely opposite path to the circus otherwise starting next week, please reply by Saturday with each of your baseline items from which to negotiate. Mine are:
\n1. Work orders for the L8 hallway  \n2. Approved funds to me to undertake u36 door jam and common stack repairs on behalf of OC  \n3. O'Neill not be reappointed - resolved in writing before AGM  \n4. Existing SC members take at least a 1 year break from committee  \n5. You support me recovering losses through pursuing rights to common property as an alternative to litigation  \n6. You support me establishing the google apps domain 37paulst.com which includes:
  - a) vote.37paulst.com (google forms)
  - b) calendar.37paulst.com (google calendar)
  - c) records.37paulst.com (google drive strata roll/archive)

\n> - Bellmont Façade Engineering Pty Ltd  \n- 126 New Canterbury Road  \n- Petersham NSW 2049  \n- ACN 099 050 932
\n**24 November 2017**  \nThe Proprietors of SP13385    \nc/o O’Neill Strata Management Pty Ltd  \nLevel 1/59-75 Grafton Street  \nBondi Junction NSW 2022  \nPO Box 887, Bondi Junction  \n*ATTENTION: ELIZABETH BATEMAN*
\n\n
\n**RE: GARAGE SLAB INSPECTION – SP13385 37 PAUL STREET, BONDI JUNCTION**
- - -
\nBellmont Façade Engineering was engaged by Owners Corporation to undertake a visual inspection of the structural condition of the garage ceilings located on level 1 and 2 (refer to the attached Strata plan). This inspection was undertaken on Friday, 13 October 2017 in sunny conditions, we return to site on 2nd November to inspect the garage of unit 36.
\nLocalised excavation to ascertain the condition or absence of any specific building elements or materials was not undertaken. Structural or architectural drawings were not reviewed as a part of this inspection.
\n This report has not been prepared as a remedial works specification or as a pre-purchase property report. It is not a formal technical specification suitable to be tendered on nor should it be relied upon by any third party as a form of building report.
##### OBSERVATIONS
Our inspection of the garages revealed the following:
**Carpark located on the level 1:**
(Access was available to garages 3, 16, 19, 25, 34, 36 and 37)
- • All garage areas inspected on level 1 (lower carpark) - Cracks were identified throughout the concrete soffits/ceilings – previous signs of water leaching was also noted through these cracks.
- • Unit 34 garage cracks were previously repaired (several months ago), the tenant advised that there has been no water penetration since repairs were completed (refer to photo 5).
\n…\n
##### DISCUSSION
\n…\n
\nI note that the use of catch trays only manages the symptoms of the water ingress and it does not stop water accessing the steel reinforcement (and thus causes reinforcement corrosion). Similarly, localised excavation to undertake partial repairs does not guarantee an effective identification of a leak location nor repair. Any such local repair is subject to the condition of the adjoining membrane and thus, it may not be possible to achieve good adhesion of old bitumen membranes with new systems.
\nEvidence of water penetration (to varying degrees) was noted to be occurring through the cracks in garages of the following level 1 carpark units: 3, 16, 19, 25, 34, 36 and 37)
##### RECOMMENDATIONS
\n\n…\n\n
In the short term however, it is our opinion that localised repairs could assist in prolonging the time to major remedial works. Works such as:
- • Localised spalling repairs
- • Crack injection
- • Localised membrane repairs to the upper level
- • Installation of catch tray/gutter to control water that is entering
- • Consideration to coating systems to afford some protection (and prevention against corrosion) to embedded steel reinforcement
\n\n…\n\n
As a guide, some of the works which would be of benefit are:
- • Lower level (level 1) concrete crack injection – Garage Units 3,16,19,34.36 and 37. Please
note we have not inspected all garages
- • Upper level (level 2) garage concrete spalling – Garage Units Unit 1, 7 (floor), 29, 36
- • Installation of new strip gutters drain to collect the water leaching from the garden area above – garage unit 32 and 36
\n\n…\n\n
**PHOTO 12:** Level 1 carpark – Unit 36 garage  \nConcrete spalling noted adjacent to the service pipe slab penetrations
`/* (Access was available to garages 1, 7, 13, 29, 30, 31 and 32)
 Garages located on the east side (unit 1,5,29,30,31 and 32 garage) had concrete spalling identified within the concrete ceiling wall – possible due to water penetration from above courtyard (refer to the photo 6 & 8).
 Concrete spalling was noted on the Unit 7 garage floor (refer to the photo 7).
 Signs of water leaching through the side garage ceiling wall, the strip tray was previously installed to collect the water leaching from above (unit 36 garage)
 Unit 32 south brick wall staining was identified, possible due to overfill of the strip tray.
DISCUSSION
Subsequent to our inspection, we believe that the most likely cause of the cracks we observed
during our inspection of the car park are related to concrete shrinkage, quite possibly having
occurred early in the buildings life. With time and exposure to the chloride environment as well as
the vehicle exhaust fumes, it is likely that carbonation of the concrete surface has occurred.
The effects of carbonation are the loss of the protective alkaline environment within which the
reinforcing steel has been laid in. Together with the cracks, this provides a path for chloride ion
penetration into the steel reinforcement and hence the commencement of the corrosion cell.
Notwithstanding this environment that has been created, the extent of corrosion that we identified
was generally considered to be quite minimal (whether on the floor surface or the ceiling or beam
surfaces). We believe that the corrosion could be managed effectively with basic repairs in all
instances.
Water penetration occurring from the garden area is occurring. This will require being addressed
in order to halt future water penetration and development of further spalling. Again, the extent of
water penetration occurring through the garden area above is quite minimal and at this stage, it
is our opinion that managing the existing water ingress (by creating some “catch trays”) or
localised repairs of the membrane above (locally excavating soil to repair membrane locally) may
be used to prolong the life of the membrane.
Page 3 of 7
Generally, the condition of the garage structure on levels 1 and 2 appears to be quite sound considering the age of the building. Remedial works will be necessary to repair and maintain the structure and it is our opinion that planning for these works to occur within the next 10 years should commence.
As a guide, some of the works which would be of benefit are:
 Lower level (level 1) concrete crack injection – Garage Units 3,16,19,34.36 and 37. Please
note we have not inspected all garages
 Upper level (level 2) garage concrete spalling – Garage Units Unit 1, 7 (floor), 29, 36
 Installation of new strip gutters drain to collect the water leaching from the garden area above – garage unit 32 and 36
We trust the above is in accordance with your requirements. We would be pleased to discuss with you any matter arising from this report that requires further clarification. Please do not hesitate to contact the undersigned for assistance.

\nIn that case the court found that the level of control of the managing agent meant that the agent was responsible for 80% of damage, and the Owners Corporation 20%.
\nI will look for bad faith, although most of the cases on the new act simply say there is an absolute duty which if breached is breached, full stop.

\nI haven't read those cases (or really any others). Any like those that you can separate out rather than mixed them together like that will be helpful for me to review / show others later.
\nI'm pretty interested in ultimate liability. E.g. did you see any cases that successfully blamed the agent. I'm not sure that's going to be possible. I'd love to see stuff around committee misconduct, failure of disclosure and acting in bad faith would be killer.
\n- - -  \n*On Wed, Nov 29, 2017 at 9:55 AM, Joshua Koonin josh@klasskoonin.com wrote:*
\nThere is a lot of case law out there, however in my opinion the two key cases are very clearly Rosenthal v The Owners - SP 20211 [2017] NSWCATCD 80, and Shum v the Owners Corporation SP30621 [2017] NSWCATCD 68.
\nI presume that you have read these cases and if you haven't, you should read them now.
\nThe reason that these cases are key is that they are the two cases decided under the new section 106 of the Strata Management Act. Unlike previous legislation, this provision states that the Owners Corporation has an absolute duty to repair damage to, and maintain the common property, and that there is no excuse for it failing to do so.
\nThese two cases reinforce this, and crucially establish that:
\nThe Owners Corporation will be in breach of its duties and liable for damage even if it has not acted negligently in anyway because the duty is absolute; and
\nDamages can and will be awarded against an Owners Corporation in favour of an owner even where the Owners Corporation has not been negligent.
\nAlthough these cases don't deal directly with concrete cancer, it would be extremely difficult for the Owners Corporation to argue that it is not liable on the basis of these decisions, especially as there are no contrary decisions under the new provision.
\nThe only thing of which you should be aware, is that any case you bring must be bought within two years of you becoming aware of the damage.
\nI am not sure where exactly this takes you in terms of the upcoming meeting and resolutions. My suggestion would actually be that you look at raising a resolution stating:
\nThe Owners determine that:
- (a) The Managing Agent that has acted for the Owners Corporation has failed in its duty set out in Section 106 of the Strata Schemes Management Act 2015 by failing to maintain the common property and allowing, among other issues, water leakages to emanate from the common property and concrete cancer to take hold on the common property;
- (b) The Managing Agent's ongoing provision of services to the Owners on behalf of the Owners Corporation is likely to give rise to conflicts of interest due to the likelihood of owners having to commence litigation due to the managing agent neglecting its duty set out in section 106 of the aforementioned act;
- (c) That the Owners Corporation terminate the services of the managing agent and review appropriate steps to ensure restitution in relation to damaged common property and damage arising on the common property". is in a situation of conflict of interest due to the need for potential litigation, and should be replaced.`

\n1. Do you have any records of Acro doing historical waterproofing/tiling or motion to fix to waterproof membrane, but only 1 tile above floor in multiple lots?
\n2. Can you let me know if/why the committee is holding up getting MDP to finish fixing my floor? As much as it kills everyone that I am devil's advocate, I didn't cause rust in my apartment, not in the common hallway. I've barely lived here.

\nSITE INSPECTION & ADVICE  \nNo: 1058   \nAttention: Mr Jonathon Kresner  \nDate: 31 October 2017
\n
\nProject No: PRO0053  \nProject Name: 37 Paul Street Bondi  \nSite Contact: Emilio Calandra (0411880588)
\n##### Brief
\n1. To inspect the existing concrete floor for structural failures within the apartment No 36 or 37 Paul Street Bondi  \n2. To inspect the bathroom walls for water leaks  \n3. To inspect and comment on the stairwell / common property walls and exposed concrete slabs
\n##### Findings
\n- There were two long and minor cracks ranging from ( 0.5mm to 1.5mm gauge ) within the concrete floor structure spanning the width of the hallway and below were a old wall was removed and the 2nd crack in the floor was perpendicular to that crack back into the lining/dinning and kitchen area There were 4 steel members exposed within the concrete floor within the apartment which are affected by rust, all exposed and rusted reinforcement should be treated to prevent any further deterioration of the reinforcement within the concrete slab
\n- The two bathrooms have been striped out, it appears that the origional wall tiles were not water proofed prior to the tiles being installed which would have been the reason why the external walls of the apartment within the hallway are affected by moisture within the render, together with the front door jamb ( Metal ) which is rusted at the base of the door jamb
\n- The common property stairwell ( Masonry walls and exposed concrete slabs ) are affected by moisture, these defects are minor in nature and the exposed concrete slab edges have been repaired in various locations
\n##### Recommendations
\n- · Apartment concrete floor can be tested and assessed for structural integrity with a concrete rebound test to confirm its current strength
\n- · Concrete floor should be treated so all exposed steel members are sealed and preserved prior to any works being carried out to the existing floor structure
\n- · Entire apartment floor be topped with non shrink grout in all recesses greater than 20mm.
\n- · Entire apartment floor should have 25mmx25mm galvanised mesh installed to the concrete floor to be imbedded within the proposed tile bed as I understand the entire apartment is being tiled
\n- · Floor tiles should be glued down to the sand and cement screed with flexible tile adhesive and flexible tile grout
\n- · Bathroom walls and floors should be water proofed meeting current regulations 1058
\nI can not give advice on the common property asset as I was not shown both sides of the walls and all aspect of the slabs within the common areas

Because the client has originally removed the magnesite to this area and as per our recent email the new rate to install the screeding would be $ 120/m2. Please note that we have indicated a rate for the removal of the magnesite along the windows of $60/m2 ( Please refer to email below in red). The total cost would be $ 10,020 + GST.
> \n PLEASE BE AWARE: The cost is for a self levelling material to a maximum thickness of 10mm. The existing kitchen floor is approx. 10mm thick at present  and therefore we cannot exceed this level .  The other requirement is that the OC is responsible to pay for this amount if we are to proceed as part of the current contract.
> \nHi Dusko,  \nAs per our conversation on site today the cost to remove the magnesite 1.5m along all of the sliding doors and window at the above mentioned unit is approximately 20m2. Our cost to remove and dispose from site would be at $60/m2 + GST. Therefore the total cost for this work would be $ 1,200 + GST.   \nPlease advise on this variation. `

Based on those instructions, the owners corporation will only pay for the removal of magnesite which is required to carry out the necessary concrete repair works.
>>\nI understand Jonathon would like it all removed, and I note your comments below that it makes sense to remove it all in one go.  I will chase up feedback from the rest of the commitee on this, and consult with the strata manager.  If the owners corporation agrees to fund the removal of any additional magnesite beyond what is necessary to carry out the concrete repairs, I will let you know.
>>\nI note Jonathon would also like to remove an internal wall.  The removal of a wall will need approval - unfortunately because of changes to the law last year it will require a general meeting to either approve the work or delegate the approval function to the committee.  I'll try and hurry this process up.  In the meantime Jonathon will need an engineers report setting out which walls are to be removed, and confirming that they can safely be removed.

\n2) Master ensuite
\nIt has been suggested a likely shower waterproofing issue would be the culprit of a water leaking out from the bathroom doorway into the master bedroom. We can now there is a long history of wetness following the pattern of rusted bars in the concrete (Concrete Cancer).

\nDear Jonathon,
\nThe delay is not acceptable. The balcony sliding doors should not hold up the replacement of the stop valve in the laundry. You have complaining for weeks that the work needs to be done, and you are now delaying it for five weeks.
\nThe Act also places certain obligations on an owner or occupier to allow the owners corporation to discharge those responsibilities. S 122 of The Act grants power to an owners corporation to enter any property in order to carry out work. S.122 (5) also establishes:
\n*A person must not obstruct or hinder an owners **corporation** in the **exercise** of its **functions** *  \n*(S.122) Maximum penalty: 5 penalty units.*
\nUnless you can provide a valid reason the balcony doors impact on the tap in the laundry, instructions will be given to the plumbers to attend and repair the leak.  \nIf you again deny access to Unit 36 for these repairs any damaged caused to the common property will recovered from you.`

What we have advised is that the highlights will be a relatively small pane of glass – approximately 120mm height of glass only – due to configuration of the aluminium framing.
\nSorry to request this Peter - Pennie has been out of the emails so has missed most of this and I just want to be clear that both owners understand fully what the costs and options are.
\nPeter the original price was $22,500 + GST and a saving for deleting the highlight total of $500
\nThe new price per for unit (ie unit 35 and 36 each) unit with awning windows I assume is $22,000 + $1,630 (with awning windows) PLUS the costs for the window being made a single panel or not + GST

\nDear All
\nSo this is an awning window on top of the doors – if the door is made 2100 high, then there will be about 200mmm of frame (top and bottom of the awning) leaving 100mmm of glass in the awning window…
\nIn my opinion, the amount of glass in the top operable window is quite minimal (see attached drawing) -only 100mm of glass - and the additional elevation height of the frame ends up being 200mm…
\nIs this what the Owners want? ?? as the system for the building (when the time comes to replace the doors)??
\nPlease also note that the 2100 door height is quite minimal – especially considering when we have the option of a 2400mm high door.
\nIn my opinion, a full height door provides the simplest way forward (in terms of door design and waterproofness) as well as not having additional operable windows for maintenance and corrosion of winders etc
\nPeter requires a direction on this so he can proceed to ordering – please advise.

\nHi Peter
\nSpoke to AWS regarding a sliding window highlight. The only thing we can do is an awning style window that you push out manually. Attached is the detail that AWS provided me. Just be aware that the doors with the highlights will look slightly different that the door without as we need to use different sections to incorporate the awning windows. We can not incorporate sliding or even louvres due to the height left over with the door at 2100
\nIf they choose to go with this options I will get back to you with a price.

\nI'm not sure if this will help you decide but:
\n- Your request for air conditioning and wall removal is on the list of things to be dealt with at the general meeting of the owners on 3 May.
\n- You may get approval for air conditioning in some form (plenty of other people have it) but I wouldn't assume the owners will agree to the condenser going on the roof. I am not even sure whether putting it on the roof can be approved without a by-law because it involves you using common property.
\n- Peter says you are restricted to an inoperable highlight or no highlight for a commercial door. If you're able to find a suitable door that has an operable highlight let us know. If not, let us know what your preference is.

\n**RE: 37 PAUL STREET BONDI – UNIT 36**
\n**    PROPOSED INTERNAL WALL DEMOLITION**
\nWe have reviewed the proposed internal wall demolitions in unit 36 as requested.
\nA copy of the existing and proposed plans are attached herein.
\nWe advise that the walls proposed for demolition do not alter the structural performance of the building and therefore careful demolition can be undertaken. We note that with time, suspended slabs do sometimes deflect and apply loads to underlying walls. Such loads are not designed for and therefore are not considered to be of a structural nature. They may result in tiny movements of supported structures however due to small vibrations.
\nWe also advise that we have considered the proposed installation of the outdoor spa on the north east corner of the balcony and confirm that the additional loads applied to the structure resulting from the spa of dimensions 2,000mm x 2,000mm x 800mm deep (and filled weight of 1565 Kg) are able to be safely supported by the structure without applying undue stress.
\nShould you have further queries please contact the undersigned on 0405 430 897.
`}
// \nNOTE that we have not considered any BCA requirements with regard to placement of the spa so near to a
// balcony edge. It is likely to facilitate climbing and therefore may be considered a non-compliance.

\nIn terms of what was said. There seemed to be resentment in the air from the carpet being taken down on Monday and some misguided beliefs amongst the gentleman that I was freeloading and am not paying for any of the works. The worker gave me attitude lecturing me how the balcony was not a garbage dump, but a work environment over a tiny styrofoam box that I threw out the night before because it had a live cockroach in it. He then gave me 2c about a 20cm piece of carpet that had been leftover and not taken down by your guys on Monday. Meanwhile, they are all happy to treat it like their own trash can leaving empty bottles over the weekend.
\nI was quite offended as I am paying $20-$30k for the facade works and have made much effort to not free load in other communications with you. On top of that, Bill specified in an earlier email that MDP would cover the tipping cost of the magnecide and carpet. I have been trying for 3-4 weeks now to come to a clear understanding upon the situation and have reached out to organize the other cupboard/fixture materials that had to be broken down to get to the rust in the master bedroom.
\nSince I didn't get any confirmation from you on the fixtures, I paid for alternate arrangements to have it collected over the weekend. Had these prerequisite matters been handled more proactively, I could have been completely out of the apartment this morning. There are only a handful of items left.

\nCorrect, Jonathan has removed much of the magnesite - not all and the surface will need to be fully prepared . The balance is to be removed by MDP where necessary. The area will need to be levelled as well following the necessary rectification works.
\nCan I ask if ALL the magnesite in the unit is to be removed by the OC? For example in the lounge/dining room (or the master bedroom) or is it only a strip of about 2,000mm back from the balcony doors (and affected area around ensuite) that is to be removed?
\nPeter, for clarity - the EC or Bellmont is not involved with any internal wall removal works. So if there is any of this work, please ensure that you clarify this with Jonathan directly. I assume some approvals would be required for such works and again, I am unaware if all this has been covered off. I am happy to attend and provide advice on wall removal and structural implications if required. Jonathon please advise on this
\nPeter, this magnesite work should not affect the program of the main contract and to this extent, the Owners can allow the use of the lift for this work. The lift and travel areas will need to be suitably protected offcourse.
\nIf there is anything unclear or incorrect about any of the above, please advise so we can clarify further.

\nHi Bill
\nThe committee is happy for MDP to use the lift if need be.
\nRe unit 36 - as you may be aware, Jonathon wants to renovate his unit. I think the renovations will involve the removal of walls and removal of magnesite. The Owners Corporation has only authorised the concrete repair work (and obviously what is necessary to carry that out - e.g. removing sliding doors) in his apartment. I think he has already cleared the areas affected by the concrete repair work - in which case MDP won't need to attend to this.`

When I asked him who do he thinks is paying for his work, he was stupid enough to say not me, the company that manages the building.

\nThat said, my plan is to give MDP open and complete access to the whole apartment minus the north facing master bedroom and ensuite from tomorrow.

>> I think the U36 issue is resolvable. As advised yesterday, I spoke to Jonathon Kresner in the morning.
>> He was hoping internal and external repairs to his apartment could be done at the same time. His main concern is dust entering his apartment while he is living there. His doors don't properly seal off the dust and there is a crack in the step underneath the sliding door which lets in dust. I think the issue is that he has skin ulcers/sores at the moment and the dust is irritating them.
>> I said it made sense for MDP to do the balcony now while they were there and suggested plastic sheeting over the sliding doors and crack (which MDP agreed to provide on all units under the contract anyway) might solve the issue. I think he was happy with this. He wanted to call you to discuss first. The last message I have from him yesterday was that he had tried to call you without success, he would try to have the balcony clear by Tuesday and that MDP would have to put plastic sheeting from top to bottom. Perhaps you could contact him - 0412 327 121.

\n> The affected concrete must be removed and the steel treated or replaced depending on its condition.
\n> The more magnesite that is removed the better it is for the long term future risk of reoccurring corrosion. Ie by removing the source of chlorides then the risk is also removed. Along the front (east facing rooms) I’d recommend at least 1200mm of magnesite is removed BUT I can’t confirm that measurement as I could not see too far back (the carpet was still on most locations) and hence the extent of steel corrosion. NOTE: 1 room in unit 36 had all its magnesite removed by the Occupant (the middle room on the front elevation) but still had belongings in there so full view was still impeded.
\n> In unit 35, I would suggest the entire front strip – say 2,000 mmm back from the east elevation façade (all rooms on this face) need to be cleared and carpet peeled back to facilitate inspection of magnesite and concrete. I’m not sure if they have any other locations of magnesite delamination – the unit was heavily furnished with belongings and furniture. In unit 35 I would anticipate similar levels of deterioration to that in unit 36.
\n> Consideration could be given to installing galvanic protection along the front (ie anodes) for further additional protection.
\n> Yes, any sliding door contractor would be able to do this job with a sliding door/window system suitable to this required terrain category (ie level of performance due to wind and water). The concrete repair would need to be undertaken first.

\n> It would be useful to have your recommendations (bearing in mind we would like a cost effective solution). E.g. Does all of the magnesite need to be removed or just within X cm of the doors / what areas need to be clear of furniture in unit 35 so you can reinspect).

\n> I inspected unit 36 today and also got into unit 35. It’s not good news.
\n> Unit 36 – in short there are some significant magnesite induced corrosion issues in Bedroom 2, bedroom 3 and the lounge room. These locations are along the balcony sliding doors. In my opinion, the balcony sliding doors /fixed glazing have allowed water penetration over the years and this has resulted in the corrosion evident. The sliding doors, like the rest of the building, are relatively standard performance doors – that in today’s design requirements, would not be used on a top level, east facing, unsheltered location. To effect these repairs, the doors will need to be removed… once removed, they cannot be reinstalled as the will more than likely be damaged in the removal process. Additionally, if reinstated (ie they can somehow be salvaged during the removal process) they are not able to withstand water and wind pressures required anyway so, … if reinstalled - (they will leak).
\n> The slab in the main bedroom – just outside the ensuite is also showing signs of reinforcement corrosion. This, in my opinion would most likely be attributable to shower membrane failure. I was advised that his ensuite was not able to be used as when it is, it leaks downstairs also.
\n> Bubbling paint in the hallway – the bubbling paint occurs on the reverse and adjacent sides of the laundry tub (i.e. behind main entrance door as well as in the common hallway). In this location however, there is also a riser which probably covers a pipe stack. So it’s possible that the pipe stack is leaking and/or water leaks from the laundry tub pipes OR overflow out of the laundry tub.
\n> There is significant spalling require required in this unit. In addition to this, the question will also be if all the magnesite needs to be removed or not so that the risk of more magnesite induced corrosion in this unit is eliminated ?
\n> Jonathan seems to be emptying his unit in anticipation of remedial works and is claiming he can live in it.
\n> Unit 35 – (PICS 517, 518, 519) this unit is very very full of belongings and I could only access a small section of the balcony sliding door on the east elevation. Cracked topping was identified in this location beneath the carpet – however I could not lift anymore carpet (as the unit was so full of belongings). I could not access any other areas in the unit.

The Superintendent checks the work progress regularly and if there is any spalling identified it will be treated and rectified accordingly. He also photographed your balcony doors which will be seen to as mentioned by him.</ins>

\nIn order to address the magnesite related reinforcement corrosion, we will need to peel back your carpet in the affected areas. This will mean that any furniture in the rooms will need to be moved for the duration of the magnesite repair works. Generally, carpet which is in sound condition can be peeled back and then restretched into position upon completion of works.

\nFirst, apologies for my father's emails last year. Keppelgate is quite sentimental for him and as he approaches 80, he has become unnecessarily more anxious and overprotective.

\nOn my end, I'm growing more financially concerned daily with the Balcony project. The project is dragging terribly. Few to no builders on site while we are paying for substantial scaffolding.
\nThe visibility of committee decision making has and continues to be unnerving. The notice board downstairs has not been updated in what looks like half a year. It still shows the tiling project completed this past Christmas and never reflects upcoming dates of importance like the AGM.
\nAs it was made clear, I am unwelcome at committee meetings where matters of significant financial impact are discussed and handled - I request details including minutes and all financials/ budgets from meetings held last year and from now. Per NSW Strata Legislation, the Secretary is required to maintain these records. I would appreciate them forwarded via email. If you desire, I can help set up a distribution list so that anyone in the building may also receive if subscribed.
\nPlease provide immediate vision into the progress and budget of the tiling project. I am very frustrated with the possibility of this blowing out when the scope did not include the decrepit railing and sliding windows/doors. One bedroom does not close/ lock leaving my apartment vulnerable. My living room window door no longer seals at the top, so I have moths and mosquitoes inside every evening.

\nIn response to your letter of 11th October 2016 which makes no mention of previous e-mails to you on this matter.
\nOn the 16th August 2016 you were advised the tiles above the first course are the owner's responsibility, except if the wall is a boundary wall. I'm unaware of any work undertaken within Unit 36, however the fact remains that some of the cost is the owner's responsibility. If, as a result of using the shower, water leaks into the unit below and you still maintain the repair is not your responsibility the owners corporation can undertake the repair and recover the cost from the owner, if so authorised by the committee. There has been no response to that e-mail.
\nThe leak is not caused by leaking pipes as claimed in your letter but the condition of the walls and floor tiles in the ensuite bathroom. This has been pointed out to you several times but you continue to ignore that advice. Ryan Coates from Megasealed has advised the majority of the wall tiles have cracked which require re-tiling and waterproofing. This is an owners expense. The owners corporation has no record of any work being undertaken previously in the ensuite. In relation to the withholding of payment of the Special Levies, interest is accruing an 10% per annum until paid. This is not a commercial transaction. An owner is required to pay all of the levy contributions, whether standard or special, and will suffer the penalties if not paid in accordance with the Act. In other words an owner cannot withhold action for the perceived delay in the owners corporation repairing the common property. In this instance this is not the case as the owner is responsible for the waterproofing and retiling of the ensuite shower walls.
\nYours faithfully,  \nJohn O'Neill`

- - -
\nO’Neill Strata Management  \nP O Box 887  \nBondi Junction  NSW  1355  \nAttn: Elizabeth Bateman
\nDear Elizabeth
\n**RE: STRATA PLAN 13385 – 37 PAUL ST, BONDI JUNCTION**  \n**    LEAKING BATHROOM – UNIT 36**
\nFor twelve months now the Committee of the Strata Body and the Manager have obfuscated in relation to solving this problem.
\nI have refrained during this time by not using my ensuite bathroom thus mitigating, for Body Corporate, the problem so as not to cause damage to the unit holder below.
\nAs the Committee shows little concern about my situation, unless the problem is resolved I will start to reuse my shower and the substantial extra cost from damage incurred below me will be entirely at the hand of the Body Corporate Committee.
\nIncidentally I received this week amongst other items the Strata Special Levy bill in relation to the building tiling and membrane work.  I cannot see that water damage occurring from leaking body corporate pipes through the membrane in MY unit is any different than the membrane levy to fix leaking verandah floors below that applies to all Strata Unit holders.  You will note that I have withheld payment of Special Levy charges now for twelve months and will not pay them until there is a resolution of my pipes and membrane bathroom issue.  When my bathroom issue is wholly resolved, the Special Levy will be reasonably due and payable.
\nI note that Unit 32 directly below my Unit has had extensive plumbing work carried out in the last week to fix leaking water pipes in which his whole bathroom has been replaced.
\nThere is a simple building solution to the problem which needs to be handled by professionals.  Please do not waste Body Corporate funds on sending incompetent plumbers as has happened four times in the past year.
\nI would appreciate in receiving their written reports, which have previously requested and not received.
\nIt is time for the obfuscation to stop.  Twelve months is just too long.  If a satisfactory resolution is not found within 21 days of this letter, I intend to pursue the matter under Section 62 of the Strata Management Act and seek costs (legal and others) for failure of the Committee of the Body Corporate to take appropriate action.
\nSincerely
\nL Kresner for,  \nJonathon Kresner` }

16 August 2016
\nO'Neill Strata Management Pty Ltd  \nPO Box 887  \nBondi Junction NSW 1355
\n**RE: Kepple Gate : Unit 36, 37 Paul St, Bondi Junction NSW 2022**
\nThe Estate of my late mother sold the above property to my son Jonathon who has filled me in on your dealings to date and I wish to comment as follows:
-· In general, leaking shower areas come from two sources:
-  i. Leaking pipes
-  ii. Broken membranes
\nIn reference to point (i), it is unlikely this is the cause because I understand the plumber has pressure tested the water pipes for leaks (please confirm). However because the leaking occurs during shower time, that does not rule out a leaking pipe because it could be above the level where the taps are turned off (ie the general area above or just below or including the shower head).
\nAs previously suggested, a confirmation that it is not a split pipe by the plumber would be the first step.
\n(ii) The leaking into the shower base (hence through the wall out to the slab in the bedroom) could be coming from the walls or the base through the tiles.  \nHowever, this suggests the membrane was broken or had been penetrated, allowing water through the shower wall. This building was built by Mirvac in the early ‘70’s and at that time, paint on the membranes was only new (and therefore there may not be paint on the membrane). Prior to that time, leaking bathrooms were a continuous problem.
\n**RECOGNISED FIXING METHOD**
\n- · Remove wall tiles up past shower head height (jack hammered off)
- · Also remove cement render upon which tiles were affixed
- · Remove shower screens etc
- · Remove taps
- · Replaster rendered walls
- · Apply continuous industry-recognized membrane in shower recess
- · Fill shower base with water, leave to stand for 2 hours to make sure there are no leaks
- · Re-tile, re-grout, replace screens and return taps.
- · Above is the recognised building industry method – any other attempt/method is likely to be problematic, temporary and a short term waste of money.
\nI believe the Body Corp should do the job once only, but properly. In this case there should be no short cuts.
\nMy son has not been able to use the bathroom over the last several weeks which is unrealistic. If he chooses to have another person living in this apartment, he will have no alternative but use the shower. There is no point delaying and deferring what you will eventually have to do in the future. If the shower leaks down into the units below, the repairs will be far more expensive in the long run.
\nI feel it is important to be realistic about this – if I can be of any further assistance, please don’t hesitate to call me on 9335 5666.
\nYours sincerely  \nL. J. Kresner (Laurie)`

\nAre they proposing to do a membrane under the tiles? The membrane needs to go up the whole wall above the shower head.
\nIn general terms, even if you are responsible for the tiles, the strata is responsible for the waterproofing. The company you have attached seem to have some system where they waterproof on top of the tiles? I would think this is a bodge job approach. But if the tiling is the waterproofing solution, then the strata would need to do all of the tiling, if they are proposing doing a water proofing membrane under the tiles, they would need to do what I mentioned before.
\nHave they tested to see if there are any leaking pipes behind the wall? (pressure tested)
\nFurther, in relation to the strata only being responsible for the first row of tiles, I would check this, if the damage to the tiles was the direct result of the waterproofing failure, and the waterproofing failure is the strata’s responsibility, then I would have thought so would the tiles have been? Don’t they have strata insurance they would claim this against?
\nFurther if it isn’t fixed properly being on the top floor the leak will keep penetrating to all the units below you.`

\nON 13-JAN-2016, the following orders were made:
\n1. An order is made pursuant to the provisions of the Strata Schemes Management Act 1996 (the Management Act) that the respondent shall remove the new windows and doors installed by him on lot 6 and shall replace them with windows and doors of the same material and design as those that were removed by him without the consent of the Owners Corporation.
\n2. All work to be completed within 30 days of the date of these orders.
\nPlease see attached Reasons for Decision
\nJeffery Smith  \nAdjudicator  \n14/01/16
\n…
\n12) It was noted that pursuant to the applicant's obligation to repair and maintain the common property, the Owners Corporation had recently replaced the balcony doors to lot 37 with matching doors.

The cracks will be repaired when the balcony is retiled but please, keep an eye out to see if it widens further. Perhaps a pencil or something wedged in to see if it loosens might be an idea.
\nPS No one else has such a problem to date.

\nCan I please suggest that all future requests are forwarded to Strata in the first instance rather than the committee?
\nNormally, any issues, complaints, requests are emailed to strata on admin@oneillstrata.com admin@oneillstrata.com or via a phone call. This would include such items as noise complaints, service requests (eg water leaks) etc. Then, where committee approval is required, the strata manager will contact us
\nThe committee members are normally only contacted directly in case of emergency
\nRe: your suggestion about log. While I completely understand where you are coming from in regards to the noise (have been at home myself for the last few months and have been just as much affected and annoyed by it as you have), there are practical difficulties in implementing it. My thoughts are:
\n- · If someone disregards the noise guidelines and/or creates out of hours noise, do you think they will bother with following the noise notification procedure for the log? How do you propose to ensure and monitor compliance?  \n- · there is also a fine line between the reasonable noise that is part of everyday living (as annoying as picture hanging is!) and the sort of noise that requires notification (eg construction/demolition noise).
\nIn the meantime, if the noise is unreasonable (which I agree with you it has been on a number of occasions and really early in the morning too!), then the best approach is to contact Strata, so that they can raise it directly with the owner/tenant for resolution
\nHope this helps!

\nJohn, regarding the rubbish protocol. Neither I or the Exec Comm. can police each floor so it would be appreciated it if you could nudge whoever is breaching the rules. Thought the notice would help but it obviously hasn’t so a little help from someone caring on the floor would be a good thing. The Exec try to manage their own floor but can’t be expected to do the building.
\nI have contacted Acro plumbing and they will be in touch as soon as possible regarding your ensuite shower. Please bear in mind that we have had a considerable amount of rain and that they have been on leave so no doubt they may take a little time to get to you.
\nEach unit was originally provided with one remote. (They are all old and grey.) The combination number was changed a while back and are: Numbers 2 - 5 - 8 - 9 are UP Numbers 1- 3 - 4 - 6 - 7 - 10 are DOWN. Hope this helps, otherwise you will have to purchase a new one and reset.
\nWhen you have a minute, I’d like to have a look at the crack in your balcony glass as it is difficult to determine by the photograph.
\nU 33 are now installed and I believe the jackhammering has stopped. What you heard no doubt was picture hanging which one really can’t do much about. If you are bothered, just have a chat to the owner, Alan & Jackie Rosenfield who I’m sure will fit into your timeline.`

\nOther matters I'd like to field:
\n1. The body corporate was kind enough to send a plumber who unfortunately failed to fix the continuing leak issue from my ensuite to bedroom. Could you advise on how to proceed? I am not using the shower as much as I would like and I'm worried this could get hairy if I did.
\n2. I've not been able to find a remote control for the gate car park. Could you organize a replacement for me? Do you know if one was ever sent to Rose Kresner or when the gate was most recently replaced or reconfigured. There's an old gray one here which I've tried with fresh batteries and no luck.
\n3. One of my glass panels has a crack, probably heat or wind related. The window is on the north side of the building above the entrance to the garage and it could become a very serious hazard. Picture attached.
\n4. When I last checked in about the jackhammering noise from Unit 33, though it had been waking me for almost 2 months, the builder promised it was from emergency work that was decided the day before. The noise continued through December and I last heard (was woken) by it yesterday. Could some shed light on how long this is expected?`

However, as you can see below, they had water damage in their carpet and mould had set in so it had to be removed. They also removed the wet magnasite. Probably finished but don’t know. Guess it can’t be helped as many of the units are still in their original state.

For your client's reference, the following issues might make waiting until mediation/NCAT hearing already in process the most reasonable path forward for resolution around the contested ledger you have shared in your letter dated Apr 10th:
\n1. Breach by SP13385 of s106 Statutory Duty making my lot uninhabitable for over a year
\n- OSM illegitimately revoking my voting rights and labeling Lot 36 as unfinancial on general meeting minutes
\n- Failure to keep records according to SSMA2015 guidelines and provide committee meetings/voting & financial information upon request
\n- Illegitimately charging common property invoices to the Lot 36 ledger
\n- Charging interest on illegitimate items making it impossible to know how much was rightfully due
\n- Failure by OSM by written email request and address 2017 AGM agenda item to properly disclose details of transactions in question to ascertain correct owed amounts
\n- Ignorance of SP13385 Special By-Laws in accounting for and calculating special levy amounts supposedly owed
\n- Privileged misuse of SP13385 funds for Committee members for personal use in breach of By-Laws
\n- Ignorance and disregard for SSMA2015 capital works and levy estimation compliance in calculating necessary admin and capital works levies for diligent maintenance
\n- Deceitful accounting practices and fee structures, including OSM withholding instrument of appointment from owners before un-consented execution
\n- Failure by OSM to give notice of levies according to SSMA2015 guidelines
\n- Questionable conduct by OSM and Strata Committee members surrounding requested ledger items

\nPursuant to Section 227 of the Strata Schemes Management Act 2015, the Registrar and Director must not accept an application for an order unless satisfied that mediation has either been attempted or mediation is not necessary or appropriate.
\nI have considered waiving the mediation requirement however the matter the subject of the application is appropriate for mediation and the mediation would be beneficial to the parties in these circumstances.
\nIt is mandatory that mediation is attempted prior to an application being lodged with the Tribunal and the evidence of mediation must be provided at the time of lodging the application. The mediation must be related to the issues raised in the application.
\nShould you require any information you may contact NSW Fair Trading on 133 220.

- - -
**[Have you reviewed your by-laws?](https://www.fairtrading.nsw.gov.au/ftw/Tenants_and_home_owners/Strata_schemes/Bylaws_in_your_strata_scheme.page)**
\nStrata laws require all schemes to review their by-laws by 30 November 2017.
\nWith the deadline fast approaching, now is the time for schemes to organise a meeting of the owners corporation to review their by-laws (if your scheme has not already done so).
\nThis is a chance for owners to consider whether their existing by-laws are still suitable or if changes are needed to improve the scheme's operation. You can adopt any or all of the [model by-laws])(https://www.fairtrading.nsw.gov.au/ftw/Tenants_and_home_owners/Strata_schemes/Bylaws_in_your_strata_scheme.page#Model_by-laws), or simply use them as a guide when making by-laws that suit your scheme.
\nIf, as a result of the review, your scheme proposes changes to the by-laws, these must be put to a special resolution vote at a meeting of the owners corporation. The new by-laws must also be registered with the NSW Office of the Registrar General within 6 months after the special resolution has been passed. This can be done by lodging a Consolidation/Change of By-Laws form. Tenants must also be informed of any [change in by-laws](http://rgdirections.lpi.nsw.gov.au/land_dealings/dealing_requirements/strata_title_schemes/change__bylaws).
\nIf no changes are needed as a result of the review of [your scheme's by-laws](https://www.fairtrading.nsw.gov.au/ftw/Tenants_and_home_owners/Strata_schemes/Bylaws_in_your_strata_scheme.page), nothing further needs to be done.

**Strata building bond and inspections scheme commences 1 January 2018**
\nThe new strata building bond and inspections scheme is due to start on 1 January 2018.
\nUnder the new scheme, developers of new residential and mixed use high-rise strata developments which are four storeys or higher will be required to lodge a building bond with NSW Fair Trading. The amount secured by a building bond is to be 2% of the contract price for the building work.
\nAny defective building work identified between 15 and 18 months but not rectified by the builder before the end of 24 months may be rectified using an amount secured by the building bond.

\nA reminder that owners must review their [strata scheme by-laws](https://www.fairtrading.nsw.gov.au/ftw/Tenants_and_home_owners/Strata_schemes/Bylaws_in_your_strata_scheme.page) by 30 November 2017. Make sure you are part of the conversations and meetings that could change the by-laws of your strata complex.
\nOwners should consider which updates would best suit their lifestyles and can use [the model by-laws](http://www.fairtrading.nsw.gov.au/ftw/Tenants_and_home_owners/Strata_schemes/Bylaws_in_your_strata_scheme.page#Model_by-laws) as a guide. any changes require a special resolution vote at a meeting of the owners corporation and must also be registered with the NSW Office of the Registrar General.

**Windows safety locks in strata**
\nTo prevent children falling from windows, owners corporations must have [window safety devices](https://www.fairtrading.nsw.gov.au/ftw/Tenants_and_home_owners/Strata_schemes/Window_and_balcony_safety/Window_safety_device_requirements.page?) installed on all applicable windows by 13 March 2018 (and cover the costs of installation). This applies to openable windows more than 2m above the outside ground floor and within a child's reach (less than 1.7m above the inside floor) - see the diagram below.
\nThe devices must enable the maximum opening to be limited to 12.5cm. However, a device that allows the window to be fully opened, fully closed and also limited to 12.5cm complies with the legislation. As long as the opening can be limited to 12.5cm, complying safety devices include devices attached to a window frame or robust bars, but not lightweight fly screens. When children are in the unit or townhouse, it makes sense to use the devices at all times to prevent falls.

**Fire safety and external wall cladding**
\nAn inter-agency [Fire Safety and External Wall Cladding](http://www.fairtrading.nsw.gov.au/ftw/About_us/News_and_events/Whats_new/Fire_safety_and_external_wall_cladding.page?) Taskforce (the Taskforce) was established in June this year to develop and implement a co-ordinated, whole of government policy response to the Grenfell fire in London. On 28 July, 2017 the NSW Government announced comprehensive reforms being undertaken to further strengthen the protections in place for fire safety focusing firstly on residential buildings.
\nIf owners and occupants of buildings are concerned about fire safety in their building, they should take action without delay. Residents seeking further information are advised to contact their real estate agent, landlord, building owner or strata manager.
\nIt is recommended that real estate agents, landlords, building owners and strata managers immediately take the following actions: identify any buildings that you are responsible for that may have external wall cladding review the design, construction and approval documents for the building to determine whether cladding was installed. Seek advice about the suitability of the type of material used and the method of installation ensure that the annual fire safety statement for the building is up-to-date and all fire safety maintenance measures have been addressed consider engaging a suitable professional to review and inspect the overall fire safety of the building including the installation of any external wall cladding and provide an assessment of any steps required to maintain or improve the building fire safety.
- - -
**Fire safety requirements for building owners**
\nIt is important to note that from 1 October 2017, new laws commence that affect building owners responsible for issuing fire safety statements, including the requirement that fire safety assessments be carried out by a competent fire safety practitioner. An accreditation framework is currently being set up to accredit individuals as competent fire safety practitioners. As it will take some time for the accreditation scheme to become fully operational, the Department of Planning will be issuing interim guidance material to industry about how to select a competent fire safety practitioner. Further information can be found on the [Building Fire Safety Regulation](https://www.planning.nsw.gov.au/~/media/Files/DPE/Factsheets-and-faqs/fact-sheet-for-building-owners-on-new-fire-safety-requirements-2017-08.ashx) fact sheet issued by the Department of Planning and Environment.

**Serve notice by email**
\nTenants, landlords and agents can now serve notice by email if an email address is specified by the person for the service of documents of that kind. This means that written notice such as putting up the rent, notifying access for an inspection or to terminate the tenancy agreement can be served by email if the tenant, landlord or agent has specified an email address for the service of documents of that kind. All other requirements for serving notice remain the same, including the time frame for service. You can read more about [serving notice](https://www.fairtrading.nsw.gov.au/ftw/Tenants_and_home_owners/Being_a_landlord/During_a_tenancy/Serving_notice.page?) on our website.
\nOwners corporations can also adopt electronic communications to suit their needs in managing their strata scheme. This includes online voting, emailing meeting papers, allowing people to phone-in to meetings and more.

- Name(s) of Police Officer(s) Involved : Sg L Barret
- Where officer(s) stationed: Bondi
- Name(s) of other people involved: Jonathon Kresner
- Incident Date (Format DD/MM/YYYY HH:MM am/pm): 2016-06-28 12:30 pm
- Place of Incident: Waverley St, Bondi Junction Details of - Incident(s):
> Officer was aggressive and intimidating almost to the point of bullying. He was dismissive of concerns raised around safety and insufficient biker friendly infrastructure (lanes) and circumstance of previously being pull over by another officer less than 1 block before. I was, on my way home from picking up groceries at Westfield (without a helmet). I was already fined on Oxford and Waverly for taking the most direct route back to my residence (which could not avoid being on the footpath). Having not had a chance to got even a block and return home so that I could have a helmet - the office who uncannily turns up moments after the previous officer was quick to anger, patronizing, unrightfully - insulating "attitude" when concerns of lack of infrastructure (bike lanes) on Waverly St and aggression/uneducated Sydney drivers (compared to other countries/cities). Although I seriously doubt and hope there was no collusion, it really came across as a scheme to harass civilians and raise revenue through double fining and bullying. [Australia is the ONLY country in the world](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle_helmet_laws_by_country) that fines bikers without a helmet. I have been away for a decacde and this is the first I've heard of it.
- Are you able to identify witness or provide other evidence of the matter you are complaining of? If so please provide details. : No.
- What outcome do you want to see, or believe would be appropriate, as a result of your complaint. :
> 1. I am only fined once (My 2 block ride cost $800 for not having a helmet)  \n 2. The officers would not be accusatory, like a scene from a movie of thugs harassing people   \n 3. Better infrastructure / marked bike lanes  \n 4. Officers targeting people breaking the law in less safety compromised circumstances - since it is highly unreasonable
\n**Please confirm the details you entered are accurate. Making a false complaint about the conduct of a police officer is an offence. Providing false or misleading information during the course of an investigation into a complaint is also an offence.**`

\nI have been asked to onsent a message and attachments to you regarding development proposal at 27 Paul St.

Dear Keppelgate Owners,
\nSome of you may be unaware of the DA lodged for the building on our street. We believe that the proposed development would significantly impact on the residents of Keppelgate and also negatively affect the property values.
\nThe application in question is DA-191/2017 which covers 27 Paul St and 8-10 Council St and can be looked up [eservices.waverley.nsw.gov.au](https://eservices.waverley.nsw.gov.au/Pages/XC.Home/Home.aspx)
\nI would like to make sure that you are across this development and have a chance to express any concerns to the Waverley Council before the due date of this Friday, 23 June. You can email Council on waver@waverley.nsw.gov.au
\nThe DA is for the affordable housing - 28 rental units and 0 regular parking spots (it allows for 3 disabled parking spots only and nothing for the visitors, deliveries and regular residents):
- · the new development will exacerbate the current issues of noise, pollution (illegally dumped rubbish) and further negatively impact on traffic and parking space availability
- · sub-standard apartments will only be good enough as hostel and/or backpacker accommodation (or other businesses requiring only enough space for a bed)
- · construction (at least 1-2 years!) will impact the residents living on the street (entry and exit of constriction vehicles and builders, as well as noise)
\nAttached is a letter sent earlier to the residents + the link to the [Save The Paul Street website](https://www.savepaulst.com)
\nPlease take action and help make change before it is too late!`

>> The call was received from a gentleman in the unit building next door who could hear the operating smoke detector coming from your building. After a lot of investigating we eventually narrowed it down to unit 35 on the top floor. The detector in the unit was a battery operated one that was probably in alarm due to there being a fair bit of dust and dirt in the unit due to its renovations, with all the windows open the wind was blowing the dust around. I found it a bit surprising that someone in your building who had obviously been hearing the operating fire alarm instead of reporting it to the Fire Brigade put several post it notes on the door to unit 35 complaining of the noise and that they could not sleep, this sort of inaction can have very severe consequences.  \nI did leave my card in the door jamb above the handle so I presume that someone entered the unit after we left if the card was found on the floor inside the unit  \nHoping that this answers all of your questions

'15f6aedb50181028': { f: 'JK', md: `Hello,
\nI am resident/owner of Unit 36 at one of MDP's current construction sites - 37 Paul St, Bondi Junction.
\nI have been very disappointed with internal concrete repairs and replacement of sliding doors of my unit. Having taken over 6 months, without any set timeline expectations, I have basically been homeless and traveling overseas waiting until internal and balcony works conclude.
\nDuring this period:
- - I have been harassed by MDP contractors for leaving small items of rubbish on my own balcony. - My apartment has been utilized (against contract) as storage and thoroughfare with contracts leaving doors unlocked and even wide open.
- - Had various items stolen out of my premises? Some returned previously on request. Most recently a Ryobi vacume and grey 15m extension chord. I believe I spotted the machine in one of the contracts ute's
    - ![IMG_6850.JPG](__IMG_6850.JPG__inln.jpg) ![IMG_6474.JPG](__IMG_6474.JPG__inln.jpg)
- - Most concerning is the main living room sliding doors were installed with a faulty handle that doesn't lock. For two weeks I have requested when this might be attended without reply.
\nAfter the way MDP contractors have disrespected the security of my home, the current situation is very unreasonable and concerning.
\nCould someone please get back to me with an update either by reply to this email or mobile

As such, we would begin assisting you with an advice on the situation looking at your prospects of success, whether you can waive mediation, whether there are grounds for an interim order, and the evidentiary gaps for a claim.
\nBefore we advise you of your situation we would take money upfront and hold that on trust. This would be around $4,000. A claim like this in NCAT may well cost in excess of $20,000 depending on how the OC responds. Legal costs are generally non-recoverable in NCAT, however rectification and other loss because of a breach (if the tribunal makes those orders) may be recoverable.
\nOur first step is to review and advise you on prospects, if you prefer a different approach, it may be better to canvass your options for alternative representation for your matter. Other strata firms that may be able to assist are Bannermans Lawyers, or J.S Mueller & Co.

I actually caught Chris over video call and here you have your hands full. To be honest, I liked Chris. We had a long call, but didn't quite walk away with direction and diving into all your blog posts I think you might be better suited.
\nChris make a comment that I'm not the usual punter. I've done a lot of research and compiled a great deal of evidence. So much so that engaging KBL to do everything on my behalf may be too cost prohibitive. We spoke about me doing my own NCAT application and you guys looking it over. But I think it might be helpful to get tibits of advice and a letter here and there send on my behalf. I don't know if your blogs comments system took my comments or not. Let me know if I can pay you to answer the following?
\n[NSW strata management agreements transitional arrangements](https://allisonbensonau.com/2017/06/01/nsw-strata-management-agreements-transitional-arrangements-31-may-2017): What are your thoughts, if the Strata Agent is withholding an agreement from owners, only allowing an encumbered chairperson to see an sign the Agreement? Am I (a single owner) a “Person” as mentioned under 55(1) empowered to deny fees and commission when: I never had the agreement served or presented after many requests – Had any say or control or even visibility over fees, charges and commissions – The Agent circumvented procedure of appointment empowering OC to choose delegation – Failed duty to record and present how they exercised function for owners corporation
\n[decision making - how are decisions made informally in accordance with legislation](https://allisonbensonau.com/2015/08/03/decision-making-in-an-owners-corporations-how-are-decisions-made-informally-over-coffee-or-in-accordance-with-legislation): If a Strata Committee refuses to hold formal meetings or share correspondence by and between committee members, what are the implications/options?
\n[By-laws rules](https://allisonbensonau.com/2015/05/31/when-your-home-isnt-necessarily-your-castle-by-laws-rules-what-are-they-who-do-they-bind-can-they-be-enforced): How do you deal with a situation where your committee and Agent are running around by-lawlessly organizing perks/repairs out of OC funds, drafted to be at their expense in By-laws they ignore? Can an action to enforce the by-laws through an action for a breach of a covenant be done in Tribunal? Or does it need to go to a different court?
\n[Self managed strata schemes v strata managing agents](https://allisonbensonau.com/2015/03/04/a-game-of-thrones-or-a-game-of-knowns-self-managed-strata-schemes-v-strata-managing-agents): Sounds good in theory. Do you recommend any particular agents in Sydney? Ours is creating even more problems that the situation you describe. Agent doesn’t respect SSMA and PSBAA. Thus the Committee do whatever they like. Together they monopolize and obstruct fair procedures and record keeping around General Meetings. I’m hoping Electronic meetings, records access and one day unmanned online services can allows Owners Corporations to operate fairly and efficiently without Agents.
\n[Privacy as part of an owners corporation](https://allisonbensonau.com/2014/07/02/who-knows-where-you-live-privacy-as-part-of-an-owners-corporation): This post was a few years ago. What are your thoughts now with the push towards electronic voting and pre-meetings discussions. I’ve been denied access to any contact information on the Strata Roll. Generally an AGM is held once a years where the Agenda stinks of Strata Agent priorities and no where near appropriate time to discuss the items and associated issues. To top it off the committee hasn’t held a formal meeting with posted minutes since 2013. Would you thinks this demonstrates unjust conduct under PSBAA2002?
\n[Strata renewal](https://allisonbensonau.com/2017/10/17/strata-renewal-and-lot-owner-consent-what-percentage-of-support-is-required-and-when): If you wanted to proposal to add a few levels on top of a building, would that be considered a “redevelopment”? Or would redevelopment mean knocking the whole building down?
\n[Strata Record keeping](https://allisonbensonau.com/2017/07/04/record-keeping-in-strata-schemes-nswwhat-needs-to-be-kept-and-for-how-long): I recently went to the office of our Agent to inspect the records. The told me I could not make digital copies and had disabled functionality in their software to save files. After 3 hours on a slow crashing computer where the monitor wasn't big enough to see an A4 notices without scrolling I was charged $105. I know that the Strata Roll was incomplete, but can't get the Agent to answer me on what is there and not there for due diligence. Since my visit they have ignored requests to come back. The committee also refuses to assist me in seeing / accessing and determining what records are properly maintained. They even charge us $120 for archive yearly and $99 for a minute book that holds a couple of meetings!

The first items are all about quickly means to sign the  Agent's contract and delegate as much function/power of running the scheme  without a chance to review the agent's performance. The Strata Agent is  meant to have recorded and prepared a presentation of how the have  conducted their duties over the past year. O'Neill has never operated with  any accountability towards SP13385.
\n**1. Minutes of last General Meeting** a) In general all O'Neill's minute taking I find incomplete and very  lacking in details. Never is there approximate times each item begins being  discussed and huge 30-60 minute conversations with very important content  disappear. A great example is EGM May 3rd, where the Owners Corp were  discussing inappropriate budgeting and consistent special levies as bad  practice. b) This meeting should be invalidated altogether since Strata manager is  only meant to have max 1 proxy vote and 0 votes if an item has them  financially vested in any way. Approving the minutes from EGM may 3rd where  a review of the agent was suggested is an example item the Agent has a  vested interest.
\n**2. Adopt audited financials** These financials do not meet SSMA2015 requirements. The opening statement  by the auditor basically attempts to not be accountable for their audit.  The committee is gifting each other and themselves out of OC (Owners  Corporation) funds. The Agents is trying to hide the full scope of their  fees. The categorization of repair costs is detrimental to administrative  and capital works planning. There is no breakdown of the $1M spent on  capital works. Every way in which you'd think an auditor should have your  back is being abused.
\n**3. Nomination for committee** This should be one of the last items of the meeting.
\n**4. No restrictions on committee** This is ridiculous. The OC should be empowered to participate all year,  otherwise things like remedial works projects go to shit and we are all  stuck with scaffold and dust for 2 years.
\n**5. Reappointment of Agent** The agent is unlawful, incompetent, unprofessional and unethical -  especially with billing. The Agent is also crippling internal governance  and damaging common property. OC should seeks compensation from O'Neill.
\n**6. Adoption of budget** NO NO NO. Where is the capital works planning. The Agent is in breach of  contract. This budget is ridiculous, not to mention does not take into  account the condition of the building, which includes extensive concrete  cancer.
\n**7. Contributions for 2018** NO WAY. The building needs a real capital works 10 year plan and full  building report of structure, painting, waterproofing, fixtures and  fittings.
\n**8. Appointment of auditor** Kelly needs to be fired along with O'Neill.
\n**9. Insurance details** Not once have O'Neill shared info on claims made under our insurance.  There's a lot to learn from this information. O'Neill should be presenting  3 alternate insurance quotes to make sure we are not being ripped off.
\n**10. Valuation for insurance** Will be deferred again for the 7th year?
\n**11. Strata Manager Comissions** Should be denied for 2018 and 2017, since Agent has not shared  contract/fees and commissions in writing. Not has the agent provided  multiple insurance quotes.
\n**12. Window Safety** What happened with the Balustrades? This item will again get deferred.
\n**13. Capital Works 10 year plan** This item will again get deferred. Why is this item after accepting the  budget? Fire O'Neill already.
\n**14. Something about By-laws** Confused by this item. I think O'Neill last minute is copying what I  implied in item 26? Just deny for clarity sake.
\n**15. Something about By-laws** Confused by this item. I think O'Neill last minute is copying what I  implied in item 26? Just deny for clarity sake.
\n**16. Authorization of fees** I'm sick of the Strata Agent inheriting revenue from us as their fees. Big  step to have this on the Agenda as last min  response to item 28. Very  dirty of them to put it before here and my item last.
\n**17. Electronic meetings/voting** This deserves 3 excluding meetings in it's own right. Ridiculous agenda  item that will no doubt get improper attention and deferred again.
\n**18|19|20|21. Special Levy(s)** No No No No. Let's start running things properly.
\n**22. Amendment to Strata Committee renovation approval function** This is a really broken bylaw. It should be revoked completely. A common  property memorandum and renovations process/committee put in place. This  building is a dirty shit show right now.
\n**23. Repeal By-law for notice/scheduling noisey works** This is the committee playing dirty after no upholding our Bylaws during  the remedial works and repairs to unit 36 which started in Feb and are  still going.
\n**24. Something by-law** Still confused.
\n**25. Police radio on roof** No thanks. I want to avoid cancer and have privacy. I can't even use the  roof for services/ why should the police?
\n**26. Bylaws review** Already too tired. Let's give this an exclusive EGM and vote for new  By-laws one at a time each couple of weeks until we have some good rules  everyone is aware of and following.
\n**27. Billing problems** Happy to defer this to Tribunal.
\n**28. Hold Agent accountable under Act** Well if we already reinstated O'Neill in (5), too late now.
\n**29. Inspection of records** Happy to defer this to Tribunal.
\n**30. Strata roll form of recrods** Start with #29 and then move on to this one. Quarterly financials received  with levy notices is a my main concern.`

\nI have been reviewing you application and there is quite a bit to go through so I haven't yet finished the advice. I will keep working on it and send it through to you when it is complete rather than provide a summary of our advice on half the application.
\nregards, Sian`

'160f75391bff28ec': { f: 'JK', md: `Hi Allison, hope you had a nice weekend.
\nI have this gut feeling you are the best, but KB doen't have the bandwidth to handle my case right now. When I first reached out, I thought my floor would be fixed by December and that I was only going to be suing for losses up until the end of 2017. It now looks like the concrete cancer damage in my floor is worse than anticipated and it will be at least a few months before I can start a renovation and get my home/home office environment stable. It's a big deal to me that my worklife is continuing to be impeded through 2018. I can't sit patiently a week here and there without making progress towards resolving my situation.
\nI have gutted and simplified the orders down to (1) repair common property (2) be compensate for 106(5) and (3) try get the Agent's license suspended. I worry if Sian has written detailed feedback it might not have been the most productive use of hour compared to say general tips for someone like myself who's never written/seen a really solid Tribunal application.
\nHow do you wish to proceed?`

'160f7871f0c6f6d4': { f: 'Allison', md: `I reviewed your instructions, As indicated before Christmas we do have a lot of work on at the moment. This means that we may not always be able to answer your queries on the spot.  As it looks like you need a lawyer who is immediately available to respond to you we agree that it is best if we accept your termination of our engagement.
\nI can refer Colin Cunio (Strata Title Specialists) and Amanda Farmer (Lawyers Chambers) as good operators in this space if you are seeking another strata lawyer.
\nStrata inspection: Very simply, if information is not on the strata roll or the books and records of the scheme then we can’t obtain it by searching the books and records. It does not mean however that the information does not exist and for some reason has not been placed on the books and records, something which your instructions lead me to believe has been happening. This could properly be the subject of orders in your NCAT application.
\nNCAT Application: Your application is incredibly detailed and a brief 20 minute review would not in my opinion assist you. My very general advice is:
\n1. I am not certain NCAT will accept your application without mediation, it is very rare in my experience.
\n2. the orders do not make sense. They need to be put in the form of orders.
\n3. in many claims the correct legal entity for the respondent would be ‘The Owners – Strata Plan No. 13385 rather than the individual member of the strata committee and the strata manager.
\n4. you are seeking relocation costs and compensation for salary and loss of rent as an interim order. NCAT is unlikely to award damages on an interim basis before the final determination.
\n5. the structure of the application is unhelpful. It obviously took you a lot of time to do however each issue and how it relates to the orders sought needs to be set out clearly, instead they run together which is confusing to the reader and will be confusing to the NCAT member.
\n6. these are your submissions not your evidence and evidence is not appropriate under the “reasons for seeking the orders”. When placed in here, it detracts from your application.
\n7. there are allegations against the strata manager including defamation however in my brief review I could see no orders in respect of such – which is not surprising as NCAT is not the forum for a defamation action. I suggest staying away from sweeping statements not directly related to orders sought. `

'160f78e29d6e9e70': { f: 'JK', md: `Thank you, your feedback is what I was looking for last week I appreciate it and find it valuable. I will arrange payment promptly.
\nThe reasons why I don't want to target the OC and instead members of the SC personally are:
\n1. They have $50k in legal insurance funds I don't want them to tap into \n2. I don't want to sue my other neighbors / have our Strata insurance have to cover the damages \n3. I actually don't believe it's the fault of those who weren't involved because of the omissions and lack of disclosure by the SC  \n4. I believe I can present that the SC did not act in good faith. Though maybe that's not possible to argue in Tribunal.
\nDo you think those point have any bearing?`

\n#### WHAT ORDERS DO YOU WANT?
\n1. [126] Repair common property (interim order)
\n  1. Failed rooftop waterproofing membrane  \n  2. Level 8 hallway water damage  \n  3. Concrete cancer  \n  4. Damaged magnesite           \n  5. Bubbling wall paint            \n  6. Lot 36 rusted front door jam   \n  7. Waterproof common services stack abutting lot 36  \n  8. Lot 36 internal slab concrete cancer  \n  9. Leaking pipes in #36 garage (health hazard)
\n2. [106]  Recover losses from Owners Corporation       \n  1. $XX,YYY independently engaged experts & trades         \n  2. $XX,YYY demolition and disposal of damaged debris (carpet, magnesite, sand cement, tiles)         \n  3. $10,000 to install lot 36 boundary waterproofing (Ensuite, Common bathroom, Laundry)
\n3. [106] Recover losses from Strata Agent      \n  1. Damaged personal contents of leaking garage         \n  2. Master bedroom/ensuite uninhabitable Oct 2015 to Feb 2017
\n3. [188] Supply records    \n  1. Email addresses of owners and tenants         \n  2. Remedial works correspondence, engineer’s reports and voting records from 2015-2017
\n#### REASONS FOR ASKING FOR THE ABOVE ORDERS?
\n1. Repair common property abutting lot 36 and lot 36 garage    \n  1. OC obligation pursuant to the Act s 106(1) “to properly maintain and keep in a state of good and serviceable repair the common property”   \n  2. Water ingress from the rooftop has damaged the hallway slab, magnesite and carpet   \n  3. Lack of waterproofing membrane inside the common services  has caused bubbling paint on lot 36 boundary wall both inside and outside the front door.   \n  4. Lack of waterproofing membrane inside the common services  has caused bubbling paint on lot 36 boundary wall both inside and outside the front door.   \n  5. Front door jam is rusted by combination of failed rooftop waterproofing membrane and major leak resulting from SA contravention to maintain main stop gap   \n  6. Internal slab has cracks and rusted steel bars throughout. A hard floor (tiles) cannot be laid without further steel expansion / spalling cracking /unleveling a new floor   \n  7. Lot 36 has been uninhabitable since February 2017. The owner is suffering heavy investment and professional losses.   \n  8. Lot 36 garage has been leaking heavily every time it rains, resulting in very intense mould/health hazard and personal property damage.
\n2. Recover 106(5) losses suffered from Owners Corporation   \n  1. SA and SC consistently ignored duty to repair common property upon written request by Lot 36 owner   \n  2. Owner had to commission independent tradesmen, engineers and legal experts to establish OC responsibility   \n  3. Internal waterproofing was never addressed, hence owner requests costs to undertake works on behalf of the OC.
\n3. Recover 106(5) losses suffered from Strata Agent   \n  1. SA ignored duty to repair common property including master bedroom / ensuite leak.   \n  2. SA ignored requests to attend garage pipe leaks / health hazard / moisture damaging garage contents.   \n  3. SA stated the shower waterproofing membrane is owners responsibility when:
\n    -  No showers/laundries were originally waterproofed  \n -  The showers / laundry of lot 36 are on boundary walls  \n -  The problem is consistent with other lots    - \n  - The resulting damage was concrete cancer  \n  -  leak also resulted in magensite damage and wet/mouldy carpet effectively making the master bedroom / ensuite unrentable.
\n4. Supply records withheld by Strata Agent and Committee   \n  1. OC must prepare a Strata Roll in accordance with SSMA2015 P10 Division 1 including Information about lots (1)(c) an Australian postal address, and an email address if the holder has one, if not provided as the address for service,   \n  2. Lot 36 owner has paid to inspect the records twice and requested email addresses multiple times.   \n  3. SC has opaquely spend over $1M on remedial facade repairs. Lot 36 owner has requested visibility into informal committee decision making concerning repairs to lot 36.`

\nI also have the following comments although I have not considered the merits of your applications, nor have I seen the strata plan (and thus I am unable to comment on what areas are common property and what areas are lot property.)
\n**A Orders**
\nInterim applications
\nThere is a separate 'interim application' form for urgent applications.  On balance I do not think this is suitable for an interim order. There needs to be a real or perceived threat of damage or injury to person or property, health and safety issues or where a party will suffer severe personal or financial hardship.  Or to put it another way, you've lived with the disrepair this long.   Interim orders in strata are often used to gain access to property to inspect.
\nSection 106 (5)
\nThe entitlement to claim damages for breach of the common law duty to repair is against the OC only.   I have deleted the claim against the Strata Committee.
\nSection 188
\nPlease ensure that you have written requests under section 182 (or its predecessor under the SSMA 1996).
\n**B Reasons**
\nRepair and damages
\nThe reason you want an order to repair is that the OC has failed to repair.
\nThe reason you want an order for damages is that you have suffered loss as a result of the OC's failure to repair. `

'160fd87d7d93a8d3': { f: 'JK', md: `Great thanks. Let me have a crack at making this a bit more final/full of evidence. I just wanted to check in to see if this direction was more on track and clear.
\nI think the Strata Agent was to blame for these losses. I was going to seek the rest of the losses in a follow up application. If you think I should seek only losses from the OC then I'll combine them all into this application. I really wanted to sue the SC members and not make enemies with the whole OC. It will make a big difference probably having to live here in the future.
\nI seek interim orders because I'm loosing $20-$30k a month by the inconvenience that has been caused. I think that counts as severe financial hardship.`

\n**53   Exercise of delegated functions by strata managing agent**
\n(1) *A function delegated under this Division may, while the delegation remains unrevoked, be exercised from time to time in accordance with the delegation.*  \n(2) *Despite any delegation made under this Division, the owners corporation may continue to exercise all or any of the functions delegated. *  \n(3) *Any act or thing done or suffered by a strata managing agent while acting in the exercise of a delegation under this Division: *
\n- (a)* has the same effect as if it had been done or suffered by the owners corporation, and *  \n- (b)*  is taken to have been done or suffered by the owners corporation.*
\n(4) * This section is subject to section 56. *
\n**57   Breaches by strata managing agent **
\n(1) * If a strata managing agent has been delegated a function by an owners corporation and a breach of the duty by the owners corporation would constitute an offence under a provision of this Act, the agent is guilty of an offence under that provision (instead of the owners corporation) for any breach of the duty by the agent occurring while the delegation remains in force. *
\nAlso, someone mentioned they read previous cases where the agent had to pay or split compensation to an owner with the OC. `

'16154757980414e0': { f: 'clare', md: `\nWhether clause 57 applies depends on what function has been delegated under the Strata Management Agreement.
\nThe issues raised by you are complicated and the law as to the obligations and responsibilities of strata managers, and possible claims against them (including misleading and deceptive conduct, misstatement etc), are evolving due to the rise in strata apartments.
\nI am happy to provide you with further comments on your draft application.   However if you would like substantive advice on this particular area of law may I suggest that you obtain a written advice from counsel?  This would be the most cost efficient manner of obtaining the advice.  There are several barristers that practice in this area and I can recommend Justin Young, Carlos Mobellan and Tom Davie.

\nRick. I begged with you at every point this year. I do appreciate your responsiveness compared with every other committee member.

\n2.  That the OC reset and establish modern best practice governance complying SSMR2016 requirement for schemes to review by-laws properly consolidated under one user friendly special by-laws list duly distributed and readily accessible to interested parties
\n  - - -
\n  **Explanatory note:                                  Lax governance exposes all owers **
\n  We’ re not yet out of the woods. We’ve had almost 2 years of scaffolds, lost rent/sale income and sanity. Still more repairs are needed, so expect more levies and disruptions too. It could be worse. Non-compliance, shortcuts and untimely work all expose OC to disputes and claims - that includes you, even if you weren’t involved. Learn strata rules and help govern our building right without wasting everyone’s cash.
\n  **2017** was sloppy. Even SSMA2015 141 "the OC may, in accordance with a special resolution, change the by-laws" i.e. the governance exclusive only to the OC to establish structure to govern our scheme was outsourced leaving a trail of failure to exercise function from which running everything else smoothly flows:
\n  **2016** AGM minutes: “By-laws to be reviewed by committee before convening EMG for Owners Corporation to consider" => Unfortunately got lost in the works...
\n  28/07/2017 Payment to O'Neill Strata Management Pty Ltd: Prepare/Register $990.00 Consolidated Bylaws July 2017 => We even outsource doing things properly
\n  **2018** We're now behind SSMR2016 November 2017 deadline for all schemes to review their bylaws. Should remove insurance skeletons and use these tools to operate smooth sticky-tapeless governance observable and thus enforceable on owners, officers, occupants and visitors, short stay renters, suppliers, strata agent, building manager, builders etc.
\n  - - -
\n  Special resolutions proposed by u36 J Kesner
\n  1. Repeal ALL pre1996 scheme by-laws + ALL SP13385 specific Special By-laws  \n  2. For old SP13385 Special by-laws (one at time) reconsider, vote to re included modernized version of by-law   \n  3. For 2015 Model by-laws (one at time) vote to include contextualized version of each by-law to our building  \n  4. Incorporate electronic voting and meetings tools and procedures \n  5. Establish temporary “Governance committee” that shall cease function at the next general meeting unless resolved otherwise. The “Governance committee” will have delegated Secretarial functions to develop, document propose and if granted under resolution deploy “paperless process” to improve scheme management and transparency.
\n  Informal (non-binding) https://vote.37paulst.com/1712/amg-bylaws-informal-vote-2
\n3. Determine if isolated or shared billing and conduct frustrations and resolve bi-law express intent to act lawfully and in good faith towards each other
\n  1.  Confused by levy contribution interest calculations. Suggest proper line items might help. Invoicing consistently on 1st of month. Complying [SSMA2015 S83(e)] where due date must at least 30 days after the notice is given. Review conflicted sources / interest terms:
\n  **Strata Schemes Management Act 2015 - 85 Interest, discounts on contributions**
\n    1. A contribution, if not paid when it becomes due and payable, bears until paid simple interest at an annual rate of 10% or, if the regulations provide for another rate, that other rate.
\n    2. Interest is not payable if the contribution is paid not later than one month after it becomes due and payable.
\n  O’Neill original info / contact emails notice mid 2016 => Interest will be charged as per SSMA1996, at 10% per annum if the levy is not paid within 30 days of due day
\n  O’Neill Nov 2017 Tax Invoice => “Late Payment: If payment is not made by the due date, interest may be charged at an annual rate of 10%
\n  2. Feeling imbalance of “mutually respected equal interests and disclosure” i.e. acting without good faith.
\n  -  - Being invoiced common property expenses. Now incurring interest after citing fairtrading.nsw.gov.au that OC always responsible for common property.
\n  -  - One reverse committee members purchasing xmas wines and even new wooden flooring with OC funds.
\n  - - -
\n  Special resolution proposed by u36 J Kesner
\n  Add By-law **Commencing oath to exercise function lawfully and in good faith**
\n  *Any party undertaking paid or volunteer work associated with SP13385 may elect in writing/minutes, an oath to conduct a new duty with honesty, in compliance with all known laws, and mutual respect and disclosure towards other associated parties.*
\n4. That OC limit Strata agent circumventing disclosures, acquiring delegated officer functions without due process conferred by OC, or complying to accountability under the Act.
\n  - - -
\n  All relevant Property Agent and Strata Scheme Management sections must apply. Past non-complying order of proceedings in Agent instrument signing, without notification of delegated powers to owners, missing insurance quotation requirements, incomplete committee election without powers conferred by OC resolutions. See, Strata Scheme Management Act 2015: Part 4 Strata managing agents and building managers
\n  -  Div 1 Appointment of strata managing agent\n  -  Div 2 Function of strata managing agent\n  -  Div 3 Accountability of strata managing agent
\n5.  Enable uninhibited inspection of full strata roll to produce comprehensive record keeping stocktake
\n  - - -
\n  Via Secretary request for:
\n
\n  - a) Agent stop constructing reliable document requests
\n  - b) Agent to either
\n    1. Electronically share complete documents archive to ascertain current standing compliance with documents discussed under SSMA2015 Part 10 Records and information about strata scheme, other sections citing accountability documentations and alter relevant connected acts or regulations. \n    2. Provide comprehensive status information for every document category covered by (i)
\n6. That owner’s share any preferences for Strata Roll Form of records [SSMA2015 176]

\n  U36 J Kresner:
\n  - a) Retrospectively missing dates on notices...

The swindling of responsibility to repair concrete onto owners during private renovations will be addressed internally shortly. The comittee have worked hard for 2 years and may swap out come December or over next few years. Either way, responsibility remains with OC whose representivites will change. Your documented recommendations will be focal if any future defects or contention arise.
\nI will shortly lay a tiled floor. Already cracks appear in repair concrete. I don't know if they are of concern:

\nThis meeting I was hoping for:  \n1. Insight / referencable documentation on why various visible rust does not require similar treatment and/or perhaps less expensive/extreme treatment can be considered (someone mentioned fish oil to me the other day hah)  \n2. If MDP leaving the apartment exposed for months to salt and moisture when you directed them to use protective sheeting could have future consequence  \n3. What sections are going to fix so I can know when everything is done  \n4. Detail on how we assessed what to fix for referencible guidance as OC responsibility to undertake internal maintenance of other lots become focal.   \n5. Your warranty (# years?) that my new floor won't warp or tiles crack from structural issues - Owners responsibility recommendations (screed composition / tile size etc.) I can employ for additional durability in context of our common structure peculiarities  \n6. Opinion on likelihood of Cancer in Level 8 hallway and other levels.`
